The fluid is examined under a microscope and is checked for uric acid crystals. A uric acid blood or urine test . An ultrasound or special CT scan to look for uric acid crystal buildup in the affected joint and check for other conditions that may be causing the symptoms."], ["What are the treatments for gout?", "There are effective treatments for gout. Which treatment you get will depend on your symptoms and the cause of your gout. The goals of your treatment will be to: Reduce the pain from gout flares, by using medicines such as: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen. Acetaminophen and the anti-inflammatory drug colchicine. Oral or injected corticosteroids . Prevent future flares, for example by: Making lifestyle changes such as losing weight, limiting alcohol, and avoiding foods high in purines. If you are taking medicines that can cause high uric acid in the blood, your provider may suggest stopping or changing those medicines. If needed, taking medicines to lower uric acid in the blood. Prevent tophi and kidney stones, for example with medicines that lower uric acid in the blood.
