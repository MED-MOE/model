This can cause the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak. Because of these symptoms, some people call AFM a \"polio-like\" illness. But it is different from polio . AFM is not caused by polioviruses."

AFM can also be caused by other viruses, including flaviviruses, herpesviruses, and adenoviruses. Most people with AFM had a mild respiratory illness or fever (like you would get from a viral infection ) before they got AFM."

To find out if you have AFM, your doctor may use: A neurologic exam , including looking at where there is weakness, poor muscle tone, and decreased reflexes An MRI to look at the spinal cord and brain Lab tests on the cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid around the brain and spinal cord) Nerve conduction and electromyography (EMG) studies . These tests check nerve speed and the response of muscles to the messages from the nerves. It is important that the tests are done as soon as possible after the symptoms start."

Knowing that drinking will cause these unpleasant effects may help you stay away from alcohol. Naltrexone blocks the receptors in your brain that make you feel good when you drink alcohol. It can also reduce your craving for alcohol. This can help you cut back on your drinking. Acamprosate helps you avoid alcohol after you have quit drinking. It works on multiple brain systems to reduce your cravings, especially just after you have quit drinking. Your health care provider can help you figure out if one of these medicines is right for you. They are not addictive, so you don't have to worry about trading one addiction for another. They are not a cure, but they can help you manage AUD.

It involves working with a health care professional to identify and help change the behaviors that lead to your heavy drinking.: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) helps you identify the feelings and situations that can lead to heavy drinking. It teaches you coping skills, including how to manage stress and how to change the thoughts that cause you to want to drink. You may get CBT one-on-one with a therapist or in small groups. Motivational enhancement therapy helps you build and strengthen the motivation to change your drinking behavior. It includes about four sessions over a short period of time. The therapy starts with identifying the pros and cons of seeking treatment. Then you and your therapist work on forming a plan for making changes in your drinking. The next sessions focus on building up your confidence and developing the skills you need to be able to stick to the plan. Marital and family counseling includes spouses and other family members. It can help to repair and improve your family relationships. Studies show that strong family support through family therapy may help you to stay away from drinking. Brief interventions are short, one-on-one or small-group counseling sessions. It includes one to four sessions. The counselor gives you information about your drinking pattern and potential risks. The counselor works with you to set goals and provide ideas that may help you make a change."

If you have this condition, your body doesn't make enough alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). AAT is made by your liver. It helps protect your lungs from inflammation and irritating substances you might breathe in, such as smoke. If your liver doesn't make enough AAT, your lungs may be more easily damaged from smoking , pollution , or dust from the environment. This can lead to a serious lung condition called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ). AAT deficiency may also cause a liver disease called cirrhosis . This is more common in children who have AAT deficiency."

Your genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. AAT deficiency is caused by changes in the SERPINA1 gene , which carries instructions for making the AAT protein. These gene changes are inherited from your parents, so AAT deficiency tends to run in families: If you have two mutated copies of the gene, it means you have a condition called AAT deficiency. People with this disorder have a higher risk of getting lung disease or liver damage before the age of 45. If you have one mutated copy of the gene, you are a carrier of AAT deficiency. In these cases, this means you are at slightly higher risk of developing lung disease, especially if you have other risk factors, such as being a smoker. You could still pass the mutated gene on to your children. There are a few gene changes that cause AAT deficiency. These gene changes can: Decrease the amount of AAT protein your liver makes. Prevent your liver from making any AAT. Affect the shape of the AAT protein so that it can't move out of your liver to protect your lungs. Over time, AAT builds up in your liver and causes damage."

Your baby may need AAT testing if he or she has signs of liver disease such as jaundice or abnormal liver enzyme tests . A blood test can check the level of AAT protein in your blood. If the level is lower than normal, it is likely that you have AAT deficiency. A genetic test is the most certain way to check for AAT deficiency and should be done to confirm the results of the blood test. There are two types of genetic tests: A genotype test looks for the more common types of gene changes that can cause AAT deficiency. A phenotype test checks for changes in the AAT protein that change how it would normally work. If your lungs are affected, you may also have lung function tests to see how well your lungs are working."

                "Angioplasty is a procedure to improve blood flow in coronary arteries that have become narrow or blocked. Your coronary arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart. If you have coronary artery disease , a sticky material called plaque builds up in your coronary arteries. Plaque is made of cholesterol , calcium, and other substances in your blood. Over time, it can narrow your arteries or fully block them. When this happens, some parts of your heart don't get enough blood. Angioplasty widens the blocked part of your artery so more blood can get through. It is also called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). "

You'll get medicine to help you relax through an intravenous (IV) line. This is a small tube that goes into a vein in your hand or arm. Angioplasty is done through a blood vessel in your arm, wrist, or groin. Your doctor will: Make a small opening in that area to insert a thin tube (a catheter) into a blood vessel. Thread the tube through the vessel to your heart, using x-rays as a guide. Inject contrast dye inside your arteries. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the x-rays. Replace the first tube with another one that has a small, deflated balloon on the end. Guide the balloon inside the blockage and inflate it to push the plaque flat against the artery wall. This makes the artery wider and improves blood flow. Sometimes put a small, mesh tube into the artery to help keep it open. The tube is called a stent. Some stents have a coating of medicine that helps prevent blood clots from forming."

                "The main treatments for anxiety disorders are psychotherapy (talk therapy), medicines, or both: Psychotherapy can help you recognize and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. To be effective, it should focus on your specific anxieties and needs. There are many types; some of the types used for anxiety disorders include: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which teaches you different ways of thinking and behaving. It can help you change how you react to the things that cause you to feel fear and anxiety. It may include exposure therapy. This therapy focuses on having you confront your fears so that you will be able to do the things that you had been avoiding. Acceptance and commitment therapy may help with some anxiety disorders. It uses strategies such as mindfulness and goal setting to reduce discomfort and anxiety. Medicines to treat anxiety disorders include anti-anxiety medicines and certain antidepressants . Some types of medicines may work better for specific types of anxiety disorders. You should work closely with your provider to identify which medicine is best for you. You may need to try more than one medicine before you can find the right one. Support groups and stress management techniques may also be helpful. NIH: National Institute of Mental Health"

                "Aphasia is a language disorder that makes it hard for you to read, write, and say what you mean to say. Sometimes it makes it hard to understand what other people are saying, too. Aphasia is not a disease. It's a symptom of damage to the parts of the brain that control language. The signs of aphasia depend on which part of the brain is damaged. There are four main types of aphasia: Expressive aphasia is when you know what you want to say, but you have trouble saying or writing your thoughts. Receptive aphasia affects your ability to read and understand speech. You can hear what people say or see words on a page, but you have trouble making sense of what they mean. Global aphasia is the loss of almost all language ability. You can't speak, understand speech, read, or write. Anomic or amnesia aphasia is when you have trouble using the right words for certain things, people, places or events. In some cases, aphasia may get better on its own. But it can be a long-term condition. There's no cure, but treatment may help improve language skills."

This includes asking questions and checking to see if the person can follow simple commands. Order an imaging scan to see if there's a brain injury and what part of the brain is damaged. Possible tests include: MRI CT scan If imaging shows signs of aphasia, more tests may be needed. These tests measure how much the brain damage has affected the ability to talk, read, write, and understand. In most cases, the tests are done by a speech-language pathologist or speech therapist (a specialist who treats speech and communication disorders )."

Treatment may be one-on-one with a speech therapist or in a group. Therapy using a computer may also be helpful. The specific therapy depends on the type of language loss that a person has. It may include exercises in reading, writing, following directions, and repeating what the therapist says. Therapy may also include learning how to communicate with gestures, pictures, smartphones, or other electronic devices. Family participation may be an important part of speech therapy. Family members can learn to help with recovery in many ways, such as: Using simpler language Including the person with aphasia in conversations Repeating or writing down key words to help communicate more clearly   How much a person recovers depends on many things, including: What caused the brain injury What part of the brain was hurt How badly and how much of the brain was hurt The age and health of the person"

Changes in the electrical signals that control your heartbeat cause arrhythmias. When your heart beats faster than normal, it's called tachycardia . When your heart beats too slowly, it's called bradycardia . When the signal to beat comes too early, it's called a premature or extra heartbeat . It may feel like your heart skipped a beat. There are many types of arrhythmias. Arrhythmias may affect the upper or lower chamber of your heart. The most common type of arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation , which causes an irregular and fast heartbeat. Some arrhythmias are harmless, such as when your heart rate speeds up during exercise and slows down when you sleep. But if you have a frequent irregular rhythm, it may mean your heart isn't pumping enough blood into your body. Getting treatment and following a heart-healthy lifestyle can help control arrhythmias.

It includes your: Arteries, which carry oxygen-rich blood from your heart to your tissues and organs. Veins, which carry the blood and waste products back to your heart. Capillaries, which are tiny blood vessels that connect your small arteries to your small veins. An AVM is an abnormal tangle of arteries and veins. They are connected to each other, with no capillaries between them. Without the capillaries, the blood flow from the arteries goes directly into the veins at a faster rate than normal. Because of this, the nearby tissue does not get all the oxygen it would normally get. This lack of oxygen can lead to tissue damage and the death of nerve cells and other cells. The fast rate of blood flow can also increase the blood pressure inside the arteries and veins. This can weaken the arteries and veins. A weakened artery or blood vessel could burst or leak blood."

It may also include other types of medicines which work quickly to help open your airways. Control medicines. You take them every day to help prevent symptoms. They work by reducing airway inflammation and preventing narrowing of the airways. If you have a severe attack and the short-term relief medicines do not work, you will need emergency care. Your provider may adjust your treatment until asthma symptoms are controlled. Sometimes asthma is severe and cannot be controlled with other treatments. If you are an adult with uncontrolled asthma, in some cases your provider might suggest bronchial thermoplasty. This is a procedure that uses heat to shrink the smooth muscle in the lungs. Shrinking the muscle reduces your airway's ability to tighten and allows you to breathe more easily. The procedure has some risks, so it's important to discuss them with your provider."

Plaque is a sticky substance made up of cholesterol , fat, blood cells, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Over time, plaque hardens and causes your arteries to narrow. That limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your body. Some people may confuse atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis, but they are not the same thing: Arteriosclerosis is hardening of the arteries, which means that the arteries thicken and become less flexible. It can have several different causes. Atherosclerosis , which develops from plaque buildup, is a common type of arteriosclerosis. Atherosclerosis can affect most of the arteries in the body. It has different names, based on which arteries are affected: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is plaque buildup in the arteries of your heart. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is plaque buildup in the arteries that carry blood away from the heart to other parts of the body. It most often affects the arteries of your legs, but it can also affect the arteries of your arms or pelvis. Carotid artery disease is plaque buildup in the neck arteries. It reduces blood flow to the brain. Renal artery stenosis is plaque buildup in the arteries that supply blood to your kidneys. Vertebral artery disease is plaque buildup in the arteries that supply blood to the back of your brain. Mesenteric artery ischemia is plaque buildup in the arteries that supply your intestines with blood."

                "Doctors often have a hard time diagnosing autoimmune diseases. There's usually not a specific test to show whether you have a certain autoimmune disease. And the symptoms can be confusing. That's because many autoimmune diseases have similar symptoms. And some symptoms, such as muscle aches, are common in many other illnesses. So it can take a long time and some visits to different types of doctors to get a diagnosis. To help your doctor find out if an autoimmune disease is causing your symptoms,: Learn about the health conditions in your family history .  What health problems did your grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins have? Write down what you learn and share it with your doctor. Keep track of your symptoms, including how long they last and what makes them better or worse. Share your notes with your doctor. See a specialist who deals with the symptoms that bother you most. For example, if you have rash, see a dermatologist (skin doctor)."

You may need to try several different medicines to find which one works best for you. Some people need to take more than one medicine. It's important to take your medicine consistently. Don't stop taking it without first talking with your provider.  Contact your provider if you have any concerns about side effects from the medicines. Psychotherapy (talk therapy) can help you recognize and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. It can give you and your family support, education, skills, and coping strategies. There are several different types of psychotherapy that may help with bipolar disorder. Other treatment options include: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), a brain stimulation procedure that can help relieve symptoms. It uses a mild electric current and is done while you are under general anesthesia. ECT is most often used for severe bipolar disorder that is not getting better with other treatments. It may also be used when someone needs a treatment that will work more quickly than medicines. This might be when a person has a high risk of suicide or is catatonic (unresponsive). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a brain stimulation procedure that uses magnetic waves to relieve depression. It is not as powerful as ECT, but with rTMS, you don't need general anesthesia. It also has a low risk of negative effects on your memory and thinking. Light therapy has been shown to be effective for seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Many people with bipolar disorder also find that their depression gets worse during certain seasons, usually in the fall and winter. Light therapy may help with their symptoms. Healthy lifestyle changes, such as getting regular exercise, having a consistent sleep schedule, and keeping a mood journal, can also help with your symptoms. Bipolar disorder is a lifelong illness.

After the bleeding stops and healing takes place, your body usually breaks down and removes the blood clot. But sometimes the blood clots form where they shouldn't, your body makes too many blood clots or abnormal blood clots, or the blood clots don't break down like they should. These blood clots can be dangerous and may cause other health problems. Blood clots can form in, or travel to, the blood vessels in the limbs, lungs, brain, heart, and kidneys. The types of problems blood clots can cause will depend on where they are: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the lower leg, thigh, or pelvis. It can block a vein and cause damage to your leg. A pulmonary embolism (PE) can happen when a DVT breaks off and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs. A PE, especially if it is large, can damage your lungs and prevent your other organs from getting enough oxygen. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare blood clot in the venous sinuses in your brain. Normally the venous sinuses drain blood from your brain. CVST blocks the blood from draining and can cause a hemorrhagic stroke .

The most common way to check your blood glucose level at home is with a blood glucose meter. A blood glucose meter measures the amount of glucose in a small sample of blood, usually from your fingertip. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is another way to check your glucose levels. Most CGM systems use a tiny sensor that is inserted under your skin. The sensor measures your glucose level every few minutes. It can show changes in your glucose level throughout the day and night. A CGM system is especially useful for people who take insulin and have problems with low blood glucose. Your provider will also check your blood glucose with a blood test called an A1C .  It checks your average blood glucose level over the past three months. People with diabetes usually have an A1C test at least twice a year.

Beta blockers help your heart beat slower and with less force. This means that your heart pumps less blood through your blood vessels. Beta blockers are typically used only as a backup option or if you also have certain other conditions. Calcium channel blockers prevent calcium from entering the muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows the blood vessels to relax. Diuretics remove extra water and sodium (salt) from your body. This lowers the amount of fluid in your blood. Diuretics are often used with other high blood pressure medicines, sometimes in one combined pill. Often, two or more medicines work better than one. If these medicines do not lower your blood pressure enough, your provider may suggest that you take another type of blood pressure medicine. While taking the medicines, it is still important to keep up with your healthy lifestyle changes. Doing both helps keep blood pressure lower than lifestyle changes or medicines alone.

But when more bone is broken down than replaced, you lose bone density, also called bone mass. Bone density is a measure of the amount of calcium and other minerals in bone. Bones containing more minerals are denser. They tend to be stronger and less likely to fracture (break). Losing bone density can weaken your bones. In some cases, it can lead to osteoporosis . This is a disease which can make your bones more likely to break. Low bone density that is not low enough to be osteoporosis is sometimes called osteopenia."

Breast biopsy . Blood chemistry tests, which measure different substances in the blood, including electrolytes, fats, proteins, glucose (sugar), and enzymes. Some of the specific blood chemistry tests include a basic metabolic panel (BMP) , a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) , and an electrolyte panel . If these tests show that you have breast cancer, you will have tests that study the cancer cells. These tests help your provider decide which treatment would be best for you. The tests may include: Genetic tests for genetic changes such as in the BRCA and TP53 genes. HER2 test . HER2 is a protein involved with cell growth. It is on the outside of all breast cells. If your breast cancer cells have more HER2 than normal, they can grow more quickly and spread to other parts of the body. An estrogen and progesterone receptor test. This test measures the amount of estrogen and progesterone ( hormones ) receptors in cancer tissue. If there are more receptors than normal, the cancer is called estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive. This type of breast cancer may grow more quickly. Another step is staging the cancer. Staging involves doing tests to find out whether the cancer has spread within the breast or to other parts of the body. The tests may include other diagnostic imaging tests and a sentinel lymph node biopsy. This biopsy is done to see whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes."

Usually, your body forms new cells as needed, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer, while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of your body. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the type of cancer and how advanced it is."

Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. However, only some cancers are caused by genes passed down from your parents. Genetic changes can occur to your genes over your lifetime that affect how your cells function. Usually, your body gets rid of damaged cells before they turn cancerous, but this ability goes down as you age. Other factors that may affect your risk of developing cancer can include: Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun Smoking Your diet Physical inactivity"

                "Carpal tunnel syndrome is the name for a group of problems that includes numbness, tingling, weakness, or pain in your wrist or hand . It's a very common condition that happens when a nerve in your wrist becomes squeezed. The carpal tunnel is a narrow opening between the bones in your wrist and the ligament that holds them together.  A nerve, called the median nerve, runs from your lower arm through the carpal tunnel and into your hand. This nerve provides feeling to your thumb and first three fingers.  It also helps you move your thumb. Tendons also run from your lower arm, through the carpal tunnel, and into your hand. The tendons connect your finger bones to muscles in your arm, so you can bend your fingers. If the tendons become swollen or irritated inside the carpal tunnel, they may press on the nerve. The squeezed nerve may not work well, which can lead to numbness, weakness, and other symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome."

But it usually happens from a combination of things that affect the structures in your wrist, such as: Injury to your wrist that causes swelling, such as a sprain or broken bone Health conditions that can affect your nerves , joints , or other parts of your wrist, for example: Diabetes . Rheumatoid arthritis . A cyst or tumor in your wrist. Changes in  certain hormones , which may cause swelling from extra fluid in your body. Examples include an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), pregnancy and menopause. Problems with the way your wrist is formed. Doing the same wrist and hand movements over and over, such as: Assembly line work. Carpentry or using tools that vibrate. Knitting, gardening, or sports, such as golf. Researchers aren't sure whether long-term typing or computer use leads to carpal tunnel syndrome."

They may include: Wrist splints (usually worn at night). Rest. Medicines to reduce swelling and pain: Over-the-counter pain relievers , such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen sodium. Prescription steroids , either pills or an injection (shot) into your wrist. Other therapies (complementary and integrative medicine) . Research shows that yoga may help with pain and weakness. Some people may find acupuncture and chiropractic care helpful, but research hasn't shown that these therapies can improve carpal tunnel syndrome. If you want to try other therapies, talk with your provider first. Surgery to make more space in the carpal tunnel. Surgery may be an option if your symptoms are severe and other treatments don't work. It involves cutting the wrist ligament to take pressure off the nerve.  Recovery may take months. Carpal tunnel syndrome rarely comes back after surgery, but mild symptoms may last."

Both involve problems with gluten and can cause some of the same symptoms, such as abdominal (belly) pain and fatigue . But gluten sensitivity does not damage the small intestine like celiac disease does. Wheat allergy, a type of food allergy , is also different. With both celiac disease and wheat allergy, your immune system is reacting to wheat. But with wheat allergy, you can have some different symptoms, such as itchy eyes or trouble breathing .

Your provider may refer you to a registered dietician (a nutrition expert) who can help you learn how to eat a healthy diet without gluten. You will also need to avoid all hidden sources of gluten, such as certain supplements, cosmetics, toothpaste, etc. Reading product labels can sometimes help you avoid gluten.

                "A cervix disorder is a problem with your cervix. The cervix is part of the female reproductive system. It is the lower, narrow end of the uterus (womb), which opens into the vagina (birth canal). The cervix has a small opening that expands during childbirth. It also allows menstrual blood to leave your body. You may not have any symptoms of a cervix disorder, but routine pelvic exams and a Pap smear test can help determine if you may need treatment. Cervix disorders can include: Cervical cancer is a cancer that starts in the cells of the cervix. Cervicitis is swelling of the cervix. An infection usually causes it, but it can also be caused by skin irritation. Treatment can help you avoid potential complications like pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) . Cervical incompetence (also called cervical insufficiency) can happen during pregnancy. The opening of your cervix widens too early. This may cause you to give birth too soon , or you could lose the fetus . Cervical polyps and cysts are fleshy or fluid-filled growths on your cervix. These growths are usually benign (not cancer). They are more common during your reproductive years, especially after age 20."

Both men and women can develop reactive arthritis because of a chlamydia infection. Reactive arthritis is a type of arthritis that happens as a \"reaction\" to an infection in the body.

It is important to take all the medicine that your provider prescribed for you. Antibiotics cannot repair any permanent damage that the disease has caused. To prevent spreading the disease to your partner, you should not have sex until the infection has cleared up. If you got a one-time dose of antibiotics, you should wait 7 days after taking the medicine to have sex again. If you have to take medicine every day for 7 days, you should not have sex again until you have finished taking all of the doses of your medicine. It is common to get a repeat infection, so you need to get tested again about three months after treatment."

Your body needs some cholesterol to make hormones , vitamin D , and substances that help you digest foods. Your body makes all the cholesterol it needs. Cholesterol is also found in foods from animal sources, such as egg yolks, meat, and cheese. If you have too much cholesterol in your blood, it can combine with other substances in the blood to form plaque. Plaque sticks to the walls of your arteries. This buildup of plaque is known as atherosclerosis . It can lead to coronary artery disease , a condition in which your coronary arteries become narrow or even blocked."

Different types of lipoproteins have different purposes: HDL stands for high-density lipoprotein. It is sometimes called \"good\" cholesterol because it helps your body get rid of cholesterol.  It carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver then removes the cholesterol from your body. LDL stands for low-density lipoprotein. It is sometimes called \"bad\" cholesterol because a high LDL level leads to the buildup of plaque in your arteries. VLDL stands for very low-density lipoprotein. Some people also call VLDL a \"bad\" cholesterol because it too contributes to the buildup of plaque in your arteries.

Your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell has a different job: White blood cells help your body fight infection Red blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs Platelets help form clots to stop bleeding When you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood.

People normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes in each cell. These chromosomes contain your DNA (genetic material). In CML, part of the DNA from one chromosome moves to another chromosome. It combines with some DNA there, which creates a new gene called BCR-ABL. This gene causes your bone marrow to make an abnormal protein. This protein allows the leukemia cells to grow out of control. The Philadelphia chromosome isn't passed from parent to child. It happens during your lifetime. The cause is unknown."

When you clean, you will likely use soap (or detergent) and water to physically clean off the surfaces and objects. This may not necessarily kill the germs. But since you removed some of them, there are fewer germs that could spread infection to you. Disinfecting uses chemicals (disinfectants) to kill germs on surfaces and objects. Some common disinfectants are bleach and alcohol solutions. You usually need to leave the disinfectant on the surfaces and objects for a certain period of time to kill the germs. Disinfecting does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs. Sanitizing could be done by either cleaning, disinfecting, or both. Sanitizing means that you are lowering the number of germs to a safe level. What is considered a safe level depends on public health standards or requirements at a workplace, school, etc. For example, there are sanitizing procedures for restaurants and other facilities that prepare food. What you do to sanitize will vary, depending on your needs. You might be mopping a floor using a mop, a chemical, and water. You might use a dishwasher to sanitize the dishes. Or you could be using an antibacterial wipe on a tv remote. If you both clean and disinfect a surface or object, you can further lower the risk of spreading infection.

You will get IV (intravenous) sedatives or anesthesia, usually along with pain medicine, so you won't be awake or feel pain during the procedure. You'll lie on a table while the doctor inserts a colonoscope through your anus and into your rectum and colon. The scope inflates your large intestine with air for a better view. The camera sends a video image to a monitor so your doctor can see your colon. Once the scope reaches the opening to your small intestine, the doctor will slowly remove the scope. While doing so, your doctor will examine your colon again. If you have polyps, your doctor may remove them and send them to a lab for testing. Most polyps aren't cancer, but removing them can prevent them from becoming cancer later on. If you have abnormal tissue, your doctor may do a biopsy . The sedative or anesthesia takes time to wear off completely. You'll stay at the hospital or outpatient center for 1 to 2 hours after the procedure. Then you will need someone to drive you home. For a virtual colonoscopy: You will have the procedure at a hospital or outpatient center. It usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes. You do not need anesthesia. You'll lie on a table while a specially trained x-ray technician inserts a thin tube through your anus and into your rectum. The tube inflates your large intestine with air for a better view. The table slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the technician takes the x-ray images. You will turn over on your side or stomach to get more images taken. For a flexible sigmoidoscopy: You will have the procedure at a hospital, medical office, or outpatient center. It usually takes about 20 minutes. You do not need anesthesia. You'll lie on a table while the doctor inserts a thin tube through your anus and into your rectum. The tube inflates your large intestine with air for a better view. The camera sends a video image to a monitor so your doctor can see your lower colon. Once the scope has reached the top of the lower colon, the doctor will slowly remove the scope. While doing so, your doctor will examine your lower colon again. If you have polyps, your doctor may remove them and send them to a lab for testing.

It's the most common heart surgery in adults. You may need this surgery if you have a blocked or partially blocked artery in your heart. This surgery is often used to treat coronary artery disease (CAD). Your coronary arteries supply blood to your heart. If you have coronary artery disease, a sticky material called plaque builds up in your coronary arteries. This can cause them to harden and narrow. When this happens, some parts of your heart don't get enough blood. Before recommending surgery, your health care provider may try other treatments. These could include lifestyle changes , medicines, or angioplasty , a procedure to open your arteries. If these treatments don't help, you may need coronary artery bypass surgery."

You might need more than one bypass if you have a few blocked arteries. Methods to perform coronary artery bypass surgery include: Traditional CABG. The chest is cut open to reach the heart. A machine pumps blood through your body during the surgery. This is the most common type of CABG surgery. Off-pump CABG. The chest is cut open to reach the heart. A machine for pumping blood is not used. Minimally invasive CABG methods. Small cuts are made in the chest. A machine for pumping blood is not used. Robotic-assisted surgery.

They include: Alzheimer's disease , which is the most common form of dementia among older people. People with Alzheimer's have plaques and tangles in their brain. These are abnormal buildups of different proteins. Beta-amyloid protein clumps up and forms plaques in between your brain cells. Tau protein builds up and forms tangles inside the nerve cells of your brain. There is also a loss of connection between nerve cells in the brain. Lewy body dementia , which causes movement symptoms along with dementia. Lewy bodies are abnormal deposits of a protein in the brain. Frontotemporal disorders, which cause changes to certain parts of the brain: Changes in the frontal lobe lead to behavioral symptoms Changes in the temporal lobe lead to language and emotional disorders Vascular dementia, which involves changes to the brain's blood supply. It is often caused by a stroke or atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) in the brain. Mixed dementia, which is a combination of two or more types of dementia. For example, some people have both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Other conditions can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms, including: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a rare brain disorder Huntington's disease , an inherited, progressive brain disease Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), caused by repeated traumatic brain injury HIV-associated dementia (HAD)"

For example, people with dementia may: Get lost in a familiar neighborhood Use unusual words to refer to familiar objects Forget the name of a close family member or friend Forget old memories Need help doing tasks that they used to do by themselves Some people with dementia cannot control their emotions and their personalities may change. They may become apathetic, meaning that they are no longer interested in normal daily activities or events. They may lose their inhibitions and stop caring about other peoples' feelings. Certain types of dementia can also cause problems with balance and movement. The stages of dementia range from mild to severe.

If you are pregnant, you will most likely be screened for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. But if you have an increased chance of developing gestational diabetes, you may be tested during your first prenatal visit . Your health care provider will use one or more blood glucose tests to check for gestational diabetes. You may have the glucose challenge test, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or both. For these two tests, you will drink a sugary liquid and wait for an hour before your blood sample is taken. If you have an oral glucose tolerance test, you will also get your blood drawn after 2 and 3 hours."

If you have any diabetes health problems , they may get worse during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after you have your baby. But you will be at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later. Having diabetes during pregnancy can also affect the health of your developing baby: If you have high blood glucose levels at the beginning of your pregnancy, there is a higher risk of birth defects . Your baby will be at risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Your baby is more likely to be born early .

Some common diabetic eye problems include: Diabetic retinopathy , which is the leading cause of blindness in American adults. It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye). The blood vessels may swell and leak fluid into your eye. If it's not treated, it can cause serious problems such as vision loss and retinal detachment , where the retina is pulled away from its normal position at the back of your eye. Diabetic macular edema (DME) , which happens when blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the macula (the part of the retina needed for sharp, central vision). This usually develops in people who already have other signs of diabetic retinopathy. Glaucoma , a group of eye diseases that can damage the optic nerve (the bundle of nerves that connects the eye to the brain). Glaucoma from diabetes happens when the blood vessels in the front of your eye are damaged, and new blood vessels grow near the iris (the colored part of your eye). The blood vessels block the space where fluid drains from your eye. This causes fluid to build up and pressure to increase inside your eye. Cataract , which is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. It happens when the clear lens in the front of your eye becomes cloudy. Cataracts are common as people age. But people with diabetes are more likely to develop cataracts younger and faster than people without diabetes.

                "Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar , levels are too high. Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells. With type 1 diabetes , your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes , your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose can't get into your cells as quickly as usual. The glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood sugar levels."

                "Foot problems are common in people with diabetes. They can happen over time when high blood sugar damages the nerves and blood vessels in the feet. The nerve damage, called diabetic neuropathy , can cause numbness, tingling, pain, or a loss of feeling in your feet. If you can't feel pain, you may not know when you have a cut, blister , or ulcer (open sore) on your foot. A wound like that could get infected. The infection may not heal well because the damaged blood vessels can cause poor blood flow in your feet. Having an infection and poor blood flow can lead to gangrene . That means the muscle, skin, and other tissues start to die. If you have gangrene or a foot ulcer that does not get better with treatment, you may need an amputation . This is a surgery to cut off your damaged toe, foot, or part of your leg. It may prevent a bad infection from spreading and could save your life. But there's a lot you can do to prevent a foot wound from becoming a major health problem."

                "The best way to protect your feet is by controlling your blood sugar levels every day. This will help keep nerve and blood vessel damage from getting worse. The next step is to keep the skin of your feet healthy. Good foot care for people with diabetes includes: Checking your feet every day. Look for cuts, redness, and other changes in the skin and toenails, including warts or other spots that your shoes could rub. Make sure to check the bottoms of your feet too. Washing your feet every day. Use warm water and soap. Don't soak your feet because that can dry out your skin. After you dry your feet, you can use talcum powder or cornstarch between your toes. They soak up moisture that can cause infection. If you use lotion, don't apply it between your toes. Asking your doctor how to remove corns and calluses safely. Thick skin on your feet can rub and lead to sores. But removing it the wrong way could damage your skin. So you don't want to cut the skin or use medicated pads or liquid removers. Trimming your toenails straight across with a clipper. If it's hard for you to trim your own toenails, or if they're thick or curve into the skin, have a podiatrist (foot doctor) do it for you. Always wearing well-fitting shoes and socks or slippers to protect your feet when walking. You don't want to walk barefoot, even indoors. And be sure your shoes are smooth inside. A seam or pebble could rub your skin raw. Protecting your feet from heat and cold. Use sunscreen on exposed skin and don't walk barefoot at the beach. In cold weather, wear warm socks instead of warming your feet near a heater or fireplace. Keeping the blood flowing in your feet. Put your feet up when you're sitting. Wiggle your toes and circle your feet throughout the day. Don't wear tight socks. And get plenty of activity that's not too hard on the feet, such as walking. Getting your feet checked at your health care visits. Even if you haven't noticed a problem, it's good to have your health care provider look at your feet."

You may first get medicine to relieve the pain and relax your shoulder muscles. Once the joint is back in place, the severe pain should end. The second step is wearing a sling or other device to keep your shoulder in place. You will wear it for a few days to several weeks. The third step is rehabilitation, once the pain and swelling have improved. You will do exercises to improve your range of motion and strengthen your muscles. You may need surgery if you injure the tissues or nerves around the shoulder or if you get repeated dislocations. A dislocation can make your shoulder unstable. When that happens, it takes less force to dislocate it. This means that there is a higher risk of it happening again.

People with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21.  In some cases, they may have an extra copy of part of the chromosome. Having an extra copy of a chromosome is called trisomy. So sometimes Down syndrome is also called trisomy 21. Down syndrome is usually not inherited. It happens by chance, as an error when cells are dividing during early development of the fetus . It is not known for sure why Down syndrome occurs or how many different factors play a role. One factor that increases the risk of having a baby with Down syndrome is the age of the mother.

There are two basic types of tests that help find Down syndrome during pregnancy : Prenatal screening tests can show whether your unborn baby has a higher or lower chance of having Down syndrome. If a screening test shows that your baby could have Down syndrome, you'll need another test to find out for sure. Prenatal diagnostic tests can diagnose or rule out Down syndrome by checking the chromosomes in a sample of cells. These tests have a small risk of causing a miscarriage, so they're often done after a screening test shows that an unborn baby could have Down syndrome. After a baby is born, the provider may make an initial diagnosis of Down syndrome based on the physical signs of the syndrome. The provider can use a karyotype genetic test to confirm the diagnosis. The test can check for extra chromosomes in a sample of the baby's blood."

They are typically offered through early intervention programs in each state. Children with Down syndrome may also need extra help or attention in school, although many children are included in regular classes. Since people with Down syndrome can have birth defects and other health problems, they will need regular medical care.

                "Common types of eating disorders include: Binge-eating , which is out-of-control eating. People with binge-eating disorder keep eating even after they are full. They often eat until they feel very uncomfortable. Afterward, they usually have feelings of guilt, shame, and distress. Eating too much too often can lead to weight gain and obesity . Binge-eating disorder is the most common eating disorder in the U.S. Bulimia nervosa. People with bulimia nervosa also have periods of binge-eating. But afterwards, they purge, by making themselves throw up or using laxatives. They may also over-exercise or fast. People with bulimia nervosa may be slightly underweight, normal weight, or overweight. Anorexia nervosa. People with anorexia nervosa avoid food, severely restrict food, or eat very small quantities of only certain foods. They may see themselves as overweight, even when they are dangerously underweight. Anorexia nervosa is the least common of the three eating disorders, but it is often the most serious. It has the highest death rate of any mental disorder."

The other main type of COPD is chronic bronchitis . Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person. Emphysema affects the air sacs in your lungs. Normally, these sacs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out. In emphysema, the walls between many of the air sacs in the lungs are damaged. This causes the air sacs to lose their shape and become floppy. The damage also can destroy the walls of the air sacs, leading to fewer and larger air sacs instead of many tiny ones. This makes it harder for your lungs to move oxygen in and carbon dioxide out of your body."

And hyperplasia means too much cell growth. BPH isn't cancer and it doesn't increase your risk of getting prostate cancer . Usually, the prostate gland continues to grow during adult life. That's why BPH is the most common prostate condition in people over age 50. As the prostate gets bigger, it may press against the bladder and pinch the urethra. This can slow or block the flow of urine out of your bladder. Over time, the bladder muscle may become weak from trying to pass urine through a narrow urethra.  When this happens, your bladder may not empty completely when you urinate. A narrowed urethra and weak bladder cause many of the urinary problems you may have with BPH."

Medicines used to treat EoE are: Steroids, which can help control inflammation. These are usually topical steroids, which you swallow either from an inhaler or as a liquid. Sometimes doctors prescribe oral steroids (pills) to treat people who have serious swallowing problems or weight loss. Acid suppressors such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which may help with reflux symptoms and decrease inflammation. Monoclonal antibodies, which can reduce inflammation and may help with swallowing. They can be used in adults and children over age 12. Dietary changes for EoE include: Elimination diet. If you are on an elimination diet, you stop eating and drinking certain foods and beverages for several weeks. If you are feeling better, you add the foods back to your diet one at a time. You have repeat endoscopies to see whether or not you are tolerating those foods. There are different types of elimination diets: With one type, you first have an allergy test . Then you stop eating and drinking the foods you are allergic to. For another type, you eliminate foods and drinks that commonly cause allergies, such as dairy products, egg, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts and fish/shellfish. Elemental diet. With this diet, you stop eating and drinking all proteins. Instead, you drink an amino acid formula. Some people who do not like the taste of the formula use a feeding tube instead. If your symptoms and inflammation go away completely, you may be able to try adding foods back one at a time, to see whether you can tolerate them. Which treatment your doctor suggests depends on different factors, including your age. Some people may use more than one kind of treatment. Researchers are still trying to understand EoE and how best to treat it. If your treatment is not working well enough and you have narrowing of the esophagus, you may need dilation. This is a procedure to stretch the esophagus. This makes it easier for you to swallow."

Eating fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and halibut can also help your eyes. Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk of developing diabetes. Having diabetes puts you at higher risk of getting diabetic retinopathy or glaucoma . Get regular exercise. Exercise may help to prevent or control diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. These diseases can lead to some eye or vision problems. So if you exercise regularly, you can lower your risk of getting these eye and vision problems. Wear sunglasses. Sun exposure can damage your eyes and raise your risk of cataracts and age-related macular degeneration . Protect your eyes by using sunglasses that block out 99 to 100% of both UV-A and UV-B radiation. Wear protective eye wear. To prevent eye injuries , you need eye protection when playing certain sports, working in jobs such as factory work and construction, and doing repairs or projects in your home. Avoid smoking. Smoking increases the risk of developing age-related eye diseases such as macular degeneration and cataracts and can damage the optic nerve . Know your family medical history. Some eye diseases are inherited, so it is important to find out whether anyone in your family has had them. This can help you determine if you are at higher risk of developing an eye disease. Know your other risk factors. As you get older, you are at higher risk of developing age-related eye diseases and conditions. It is important to know your risk factors because you may be able to lower your risk by changing some behaviors. If you wear contacts, take steps to prevent eye infections. Wash your hands well before you put in or take out your contact lenses. Also follow the instructions on how to properly clean them, and replace them when needed. Give your eyes a rest. If you spend a lot of time using a computer, you can forget to blink your eyes and your eyes can get tired. To reduce eyestrain, try the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look away about 20 feet in front of you for 20 seconds."

Children usually have vision screening in school or at their health care provider's office during a checkup. Adults may also get vision screenings during their checkups. But many adults need more than a vision screening. They need a comprehensive dilated eye exam. Getting comprehensive dilated eye exams is especially important because some eye diseases may not have warning signs. The exams are the only way to detect these diseases in their early stages, when they are easier to treat. The exam includes several tests: A visual field test to measure your side (peripheral) vision. A loss of peripheral vision may be a sign of glaucoma. A visual acuity test, where you read an eye chart about 20 feet away, to check on how well you see at various distances Tonometry, which measures your eye's interior pressure. It helps to detect glaucoma. Dilation, which involves getting eye drops that dilate (widen) your pupils. This allows more light to enter the eye. Your eye care provider examines your eyes using a special magnifying lens. This provides a clear view of important tissues at the back of your eye, including the retina , macula, and optic nerve. If you have a refractive error and are going to need glasses or contacts , then you will also have a refraction test. When you have this test, you look through a device that has lenses of different strengths to help your eye care professional figure out which lenses will give you the clearest vision. At what age you should start getting these exams and how often you need them depends on many factors. They include your age, race, and overall health.  For example, if you are African American, you are at higher risk of glaucoma and you need to start getting the exams earlier. If you have diabetes, you should get an exam every year. Check with your health care provider about if and when you need these exams."

Fatigue can be a normal response to physical activity, emotional stress , boredom, or lack of sleep. But sometimes it can be a sign of a mental or physical condition. If you have been feeling tired for weeks, contact your health care provider. They can help you find out what's causing your fatigue and recommend ways to relieve it."

It can have many different causes, including pregnancy and various medical problems, treatments, and lifestyle habits such as: Medical problems: Chronic (long-lasting) diseases such as diabetes , COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and heart , liver , kidney and thyroid diseases Untreated pain and diseases like fibromyalgia Anemia Infections Parkinson's disease Sleep apnea and other sleep disorders Recent stroke Mental disorders such as depression and anxiety Treatments: Cancer treatments such as chemotherapy , radiation , and bone marrow transplants Recovering from major surgery Taking certain medicines, such as antidepressants , antihistamines, and medicines for nausea and pain Lifestyle habits: Not getting enough sleep Staying up too late Drinking too much alcohol Substance use Having too much caffeine (which can keep you from getting a good night's sleep) Getting too little or too much exercise Overwhelming fatigue is part of a disorder called myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The fatigue caused by this disorder is different from a tired feeling that goes away after you rest. Instead, the fatigue in ME/CFS lasts a long time, does not get better with rest, and limits your ability to do ordinary daily activities."

They will likely do a physical exam and order lab tests. Once they decide on a diagnosis, they can tell you what treatments might help. You can also make some lifestyle changes to feel less tired: Get regular physical activity Improve your sleep habits Stop smoking (if you smoke), since smoking is linked to many diseases that can cause fatigue Manage stress Eat a healthy diet and avoid alcohol It also may be helpful for you to keep a fatigue diary. This can help you find patterns throughout the day, such as when you feel more tired and when you have more energy. It can also help you plan for activities that may give you more energy.

There are two kinds: Simple fatty liver, in which you have fat in your liver but little or no inflammation or liver cell damage. Simple fatty liver typically does not get bad enough to cause liver damage or complications. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), in which you have inflammation and liver cell damage, as well as fat in your liver.

But the process of breaking it down can generate harmful substances. These substances can damage liver cells, promote inflammation, and weaken your body's natural defenses. The more alcohol that you drink, the more you damage your liver.  Alcoholic fatty liver disease is the earliest stage of alcohol-related liver disease. The next stages are alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis."

As the rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and high cholesterol are rising in the United States, so is the rate of NAFLD. NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disorder in the United States. Alcoholic fatty liver disease only happens in people who are heavy drinkers, especially those who have been drinking for a long period of time. The risk is higher for heavy drinkers who are women, have obesity, or have certain genetic mutations."

To make a diagnosis, your doctor will use: Your medical history A physical exam Various tests, including blood and imaging tests , and sometimes a biopsy As part of the medical history, your doctor will ask about your alcohol use, to find out whether fat in your liver is a sign of alcoholic fatty liver disease or nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD). He or she will also ask which medicines you take, to try to determine whether a medicine is causing your NAFLD. During the physical exam, your doctor will examine your body and check your weight and height. Your doctor will look for signs of fatty liver disease, such as: An enlarged liver Signs of cirrhosis, such as jaundice , a condition that causes your skin and whites of your eyes to turn yellow You will likely have blood tests, including liver function tests and blood count tests . In some cases you may also have imaging tests, like those that check for fat in the liver and the stiffness of your liver. Liver stiffness can mean fibrosis, which is scarring of the liver. In some cases you may also need a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, and to check how bad the liver damage is."

If your doctor thinks that a certain medicine is the cause of your NAFLD, you should stop taking that medicine.  But check with your doctor before stopping the medicine. You may need to get off the medicine gradually, and you might need to switch to another medicine instead. There are no medicines that have been approved to treat NAFLD. Studies are investigating whether a certain diabetes medicine or Vitamin E can help, but more studies are needed. The most important part of treating alcohol-related fatty liver disease is to stop drinking alcohol. If you need help doing that, you may want to see a therapist or participate in an alcohol recovery program. There are also medicines that can help, either by reducing your cravings or making you feel sick if you drink alcohol. Both alcoholic fatty liver disease and one type of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) can lead to cirrhosis. Doctors can treat the health problems caused by cirrhosis with medicines, operations, and other medical procedures. If the cirrhosis leads to liver failure, you may need a liver transplant ."

If you get hepatitis A or B along with fatty liver, it is more likely to lead to liver failure. People with chronic liver disease are more likely to get infections, so the other two vaccinations are also important.

Pain relievers . Lifestyle changes Getting enough sleep . Getting regular physical activity. If you have not already been active, start slowly and gradually increase how much activity you get. You may want to see a physical therapist, who can help you create a plan that is right for you. Learning how to manage stress . Learning to pace yourself. If you do too much, it can make your symptoms worse. So you need to learn to balance being active with your need for rest. Talk therapy , such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can help you learn strategies to deal with pain, stress, and negative thoughts. If you also have depression along with your fibromyalgia, talk therapy can help with that too. Complementary therapies have helped some people with the symptoms of fibromyalgia. But researchers need to do more studies to show which ones are effective. You could consider trying them, but you should check with your provider first. These therapies include: Mindfulness meditation. Biofeedback, which uses electronic devices to measure body functions such as breathing and heart rate. This teaches you to be more aware of your body functions so you can learn to control them. Movement therapies such as yoga and tai chi. Massage therapy. Acupuncture ."

In minor cases, you may just need to make some changes to your diet. In other cases, you may need other treatments. For example: If you don't have enough of an electrolyte, you may get electrolyte replacement therapy. This involves giving you more of that electrolyte. It could be a medicine or supplement that you swallow or drink, or it may be given intravenously (by IV). If you have too much of an electrolyte, your provider may give you medicines or fluids (by mouth or by IV) to help remove that electrolyte from your body.

This allows more light to enter your eye. Your eye care provider examines your eyes using a special magnifying lens. This provides a clear view of important tissues at the back of your eye to check for glaucoma or other eye problems. For a few hours after the exam your vision may be blurry and sensitive to light, so you will need someone to take you home. Visual field testing . This check of your peripheral (side) vision allows your eye care provider to find out how well you can see objects off to the side of your vision without moving your eyes. Tonometry . This measures the pressure inside your eye. If you're at higher risk for glaucoma, you should get comprehensive eye exams every one to two years. You're at higher risk if you: Are Black or African American and over age 40 Are over age 60, especially if you're Hispanic or Latino Have a family history of glaucoma You're also at higher risk if you have high blood pressure or diabetes and should get a dilated eye exam at least once a year. Talk with your provider about your risk and how often you should get your eyes checked."

Treatments can include: Prescription eye drops are the most common treatment to lower the pressure in your eye and prevent damage to your optic nerve.

                "What causes gout?",
                "Gout happens when too much uric acid (urate) builds up in your body over a long time. Uric acid is a waste product your body makes when it breaks down purines. Purines are substances that are in your body's tissues and in many foods. When your body breaks down old cells or digests foods that contain purine, most of the uric acid that's made dissolves in your blood. Your kidneys filter the uric acid out of your blood, and it leaves your body in your urine (pee). However, sometimes your body can make too much uric acid or does not remove enough of it. Then the uric acid levels build up in your body, including in your blood. Having too much uric acid in the blood is called hyperuricemia. It does not cause health problems for everyone. But in some people, uric acid forms needle-like crystals. They can form in your joints, which causes gout. The crystals can also cause kidney stones . Calcium pyrophosphate arthritis, sometimes called pseudogout, is a related disease. It causes similar symptoms and is sometimes confused with gout. But it is caused by a buildup of calcium phosphate, not uric acid."

Gout flares often start suddenly at night, and the symptoms in the affected joint often include: Intense pain, which may be bad enough to wake you up Swelling Redness Warmth The flares typically get better within a week or two. In between flares, you usually don't have symptoms. Some people may have flares often, while others may not have another flare for years. But over time, if left untreated, your flares may happen more often and last longer. And if gout is untreated over long periods of time, you can develop tophi.

Acetaminophen and the anti-inflammatory drug colchicine. Oral or injected corticosteroids . Prevent future flares, for example by: Making lifestyle changes such as losing weight, limiting alcohol, and avoiding foods high in purines. If you are taking medicines that can cause high uric acid in the blood, your provider may suggest stopping or changing those medicines. If needed, taking medicines to lower uric acid in the blood.

There are two types: Dynamic posture is how you hold yourself when you are moving, like when you are walking, running, or bending over to pick up something. Static posture is how you hold yourself when you are not moving, like when you are sitting, standing, or sleeping. It is important to make sure that you have good dynamic and static posture. The key to good posture is the position of your spine. Your spine has three natural curves - at your neck, mid back, and low back. Correct posture should maintain these curves, but not increase them. Your head should be above your shoulders, and the top of your shoulder should be over the hips."

Any kind of exercise may help improve your posture, but certain types of exercises can be especially helpful. They include yoga, tai chi, and other classes that focus on body awareness. It is also a good idea to do exercises that strengthen your core (muscles around your back, abdomen, and pelvis). Maintain a healthy weight. Extra weight can weaken your abdominal muscles, cause problems for your pelvis and spine, and contribute to low back pain. All of these can hurt your posture. Wear comfortable, low-heeled shoes. High heels, for example, can throw off your balance and force you to walk differently. This puts more stress on your muscles and harms your posture. Make sure work surfaces are at a comfortable height for you, whether you're sitting in front of a computer, making dinner, or eating a meal."

To raise your HDL level, you need to eat good fats instead of bad fats. This means limiting saturated fats, which include full-fat milk and cheese, high-fat meats like sausage and bacon, and foods made with butter, lard, and shortening. You should also avoid trans fats, which may be in some margarines, fried foods, and processed foods like baked goods. Instead, eat unsaturated fats, which are found in avocado, vegetable oils like olive oil, and nuts. Limit carbohydrates, especially sugar. Also try to eat more foods naturally high in fiber, such as oatmeal and beans. Stay at a healthy weight. You can boost your HDL level by losing weight, especially if you have lots of fat around your waist. Exercise. Getting regular exercise can raise your HDL level, as well as lower your LDL. You should try to do 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise on most, if not all, days. Avoid cigarettes. Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke can lower your HDL level. If you are a smoker, ask your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit . You should also try to avoid secondhand smoke. Limit alcohol. Moderate alcohol may lower your HDL level, although more studies are needed to confirm that. What we do know is that too much alcohol can make you gain weight, and that lowers your HDL level. Some cholesterol medicines , including certain statins , can raise your HDL level, in addition to lowering your LDL level. Health care providers don't usually prescribe medicines only to raise HDL.

In the United States and around the world, people are spending more and more time doing sedentary activities. During our leisure time, we are often sitting: while using a computer or other device, watching TV, or playing video games. Many of our jobs have become more sedentary, with long days sitting at a desk. And the way most of us get around involves sitting - in cars, on buses, and on trains."

Sleep is a complex biological process that helps you process new information, stay healthy, and feel rested. During sleep, your brain cycles through five stages: stage 1, 2, 3, 4, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Different things happen during each stage. For example, you have a different pattern of brain waves during each one. Your breathing, heart, and temperature may be slower or faster in some stages. Certain phases of sleep help you : Feel rested and energetic the next day Learn information, get insight, and form memories Give your heart and vascular system a rest Release more growth hormone, which helps children grow. It also boosts muscle mass and the repair of cells and tissues in children and adults. Release sex hormones, which contributes to puberty and fertility Keep from getting sick or help you get better when you are sick, by creating more cytokines (hormones that help the immune system fight various infections) You need all of the stages to get a healthy sleep."

                "The amount of sleep you need depends on several factors, including your age, lifestyle, health, and whether you have been getting enough sleep recently. The general recommendations for sleep are: Newborns: 16-18 hours a day Preschool-aged children: 11-12 hours a day School-aged children: At least 10 hours a day Teens: 9-10 hours a day Adults (including older adults): 7-8 hours a day During puberty, teenagers' biological clocks shift, and they are more likely to go to bed later than younger children and adults, and they tend to want to sleep later in the morning. This delayed sleep-wake rhythm conflicts with the early-morning start times of many high schools and helps explain why most teenagers do not get enough sleep. Some people think that adults need less sleep as they age. But there is no evidence to show that older adults can get by with less sleep than people who are younger. As people age, however, they often get less sleep or they tend to spend less time in the deep, restful stage of sleep. Older adults are also more easily awakened. And it's not just the number of hours of sleep you get that matters. The quality of the sleep you get is also important. People whose sleep is frequently interrupted or cut short might not get enough of certain stages of sleep. If you are wondering whether you are getting enough sleep, including quality sleep, ask yourself: Do you have trouble getting up in the morning? Do you have trouble focusing during the day? Do you doze off during the day? If you answered yes to these three questions, you should work on improving your sleep."

It can affect your performance, including your ability to think clearly, react quickly, and form memories. This may cause you to make bad decisions and take more risks. People with sleep deprivation are more likely to get into accidents. Sleep deprivation can also affect your mood, leading to: Irritability Problems with relationships, especially for children and teenagers Depression Anxiety It can also affect your physical health. Research shows that not getting enough sleep, or getting poor-quality sleep, increases your risk of: High blood pressure Heart disease Stroke Kidney disease Obesity Type 2 diabetes Not getting enough sleep can also mean that you don't get enough of the hormones that help children grow and help adults and children build muscle mass, fight infections, and repair cells.

Also, don't be tempted to go on your phone or tablet just before bed. Get enough sunlight exposure during the day Don't lie in bed awake; if you can't sleep for 20 minutes, get up and do something relaxing See a doctor if you have continued trouble sleeping. You may have a sleep disorder , such as insomnia or sleep apnea .  In some cases, your doctor may suggest trying over-the-counter or prescription sleep aid. In other cases, your doctor may want you to do a sleep study, to help diagnose the problem. If you are a shift worker, it can be even harder to get a good sleep. You may also want to: Take naps and increase the amount of time available for sleep Keep the lights bright at work Limit shift changes so your body clock can adjust Limit caffeine use to the first part of your shift Remove sound and light distractions in your bedroom during daytime sleep (for example, use light-blocking curtains)"

It typically happens during rest or routine activities. This serious condition increases your risk of having a heart attack or other heart diseases.  This type may be harder to diagnose since blockages in smaller arteries can be harder to see on imaging tests. Broken heart syndrome - Strong chest pain or other signs that look like a heart attack. It's caused by the stress of powerful emotions, such as deep grief, anger, or surprise. It can happen even if you're healthy. It mostly affects women after menopause and usually doesn't cause any lasting damage. Variant angina - A rare type of strong chest pain from spasms in the heart arteries.

A biventricular pacemaker (cardiac resynchronization therapy). A mechanical heart pump (a ventricular assist device (VAD) or a total artificial heart). Your heart doctor recommends a heart transplant because your heart failure is life-threatening and nothing else is helping. As part of your treatment, you'll need to pay close attention to your symptoms, because heart failure can worsen suddenly. Your provider may suggest a cardiac rehabilitation program to help you learn how to manage your condition."

Coronary artery disease (CAD) - when a sticky substance called plaque narrows or blocks the arteries that supply blood to your heart muscle. Makes a new path for blood to flow around the blocked part of an artery in the heart. This is called a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) , or heart bypass. It's the most common heart surgery in adults. Heart valve diseases - problems with the valves that control the flow of blood through your heart. Repairs heart valves. Replaces heart valves with a mechanical valve or a biologic valve made from pig, cow, or human heart tissue. Arrhythmia - problems with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. They are caused by changes in the electrical signals that control your heartbeat. Places a pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in the chest to correct your heartbeat. Treats atrial fibrillation with small cuts in the heart muscle. The cuts form scars that make a path for the heart's electrical signals (Maze surgery). Heart failure - when your heart is too weak or stiff to pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet your body's needs. Places a device in the chest which may include: An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) to help prevent sudden cardiac arrest . A biventricular pacemaker to coordinate the heart's pumping action so it's more powerful. A ventricular assist device to help the heart pump blood. A total artificial heart to pump blood for the heart. Replaces a seriously diseased heart with a heathy heart ( heart transplantation ). Heart aneurysm - a balloon-like bulge in the wall of an artery. It can be life-threatening if the aneurysm tears or bursts. Repairs or replaces the weak part of a heart artery using a patch or a tube made of fabric. Angina - chest pain from coronary artery disease. Uses a laser to make small channels through part of the heart muscle (transmyocardial laser revascularization). Damaged and abnormal heart structures, including congenital heart defects - heart structure problems that you're born with. Repairs heart damage or problems with how the heart and blood vessels are formed. Repairs depend on the type of defect or damage. "

Approaches to heart surgery include: Open-heart surgery (also called traditional heart surgery) is when the surgeon cuts the chest open to reach the heart. Because it's difficult to operate on a beating heart, medicines are used to stop the heart. A heart-lung bypass machine keeps oxygen-rich blood pumping through the body during the surgery. Off-pump heart surgery is open-heart surgery on a beating heart without using a heart-lung bypass machine. The surgeon holds the heart steady with a device. Surgeons may use off-pump heart surgery to do coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG), but only in certain cases. Minimally invasive heart surgery uses small cuts between the ribs. The cuts may be as small as 2 to 3 inches. The surgeon inserts tools into the chest through the cuts. This type of heart surgery may or may not use a heart-lung bypass machine. Robotic-assisted surgery is a type of minimally invasive surgery. The surgeon uses a computer to control tools on the arms of a robot.

The valves have flaps that open and close. The flaps make sure that blood flows in the right direction through your heart and to the rest of your body. When your heart beats, the flaps open to let blood through. Between heartbeats they close to stop the blood from flowing backwards. If one or more of your heart valves doesn't open or close correctly, it can affect your blood flow and strain your heart. Fortunately, treatment helps most valve diseases."

                "Heart valves can have three basic kinds of problems: Regurgitation , or backflow, happens when the flaps of a valve don't close tightly. This allows the blood to leak backwards. A common cause of regurgitation is prolapse, where the flaps of the valve flop or bulge back. Prolapse most often affects the mitral valve . Stenosis happens when the flaps of a valve become thick, stiff, or stuck together. This prevents the heart valve from opening all the way. Not enough blood can pass through the valve. Aortic valve stenosis is a common type of stenosis. It affects the valve that controls blood flow into the large artery that carries blood out of the heart to the body. Atresia happens when a heart valve did not form properly and does not have an opening for blood to pass through. Sometimes a valve can have both regurgitation and stenosis."

It starts after you are 20 weeks pregnant. You usually don't have any other symptoms. In many cases, it does not harm you or your baby, and it goes away within 12 weeks after childbirth.

Chronic hypertension is high blood pressure that starts before the 20th week of pregnancy or before you became pregnant. Some people may have had it long before becoming pregnant but didn't know it until they got their blood pressure checked at their prenatal visit . Sometimes chronic hypertension can also lead to preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a sudden increase in blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy. It usually happens in the last trimester. Preeclampsia also often includes signs of damage to some of your organs, such as your liver or kidneys. The signs may include protein in the urine (pee) and very high blood pressure. Preeclampsia can be serious or even life-threatening for both you and your baby. If preeclampsia becomes severe enough to affect your brain function and causes seizures or a coma , it is called eclampsia . In rare cases, preeclampsia symptoms may not start until after delivery. This is called postpartum preeclampsia . If this type of preeclampsia becomes more severe and causes a seizure, it is known as postpartum eclampsia .

If it is not treated, eventually the virus will weaken your body's immune system. Then the infection will progress to AIDS. This is the late stage of HIV infection. Because your immune system is badly damaged, your body cannot fight off other infections, called opportunistic infections (OIs). OIs are infections that happen more frequently or are more severe in people who have weakened immune systems. Some people may not feel sick during the earlier stages of HIV infection. So the only way to know for sure whether you have HIV is to get tested."

HIV medicines reduce the amount of HIV in the body (viral load) to a very low level. The goal is to get your viral load so low that a standard lab test can't detect it. This is called having an \"undetectable viral load.\" Having an undetectable viral load is the best thing you can do to stay healthy and prevent your baby from getting HIV. These medicines will also help protect your health. Most HIV medicines are safe to use during pregnancy. They don't usually raise the risk of birth defects . But it is important to talk with your health care provider about the risks and benefits of the different medicines. Together you can decide which medicines are right for you. Then you need to make sure you take your medicines regularly. If needed, having a cesarean delivery . If your viral load is not reduced enough by the medicines, having a cesarean delivery (C-Section) can help prevent passing HIV to your baby. Giving HIV medicines to the baby. Your baby will get HIV medicines as soon as possible after birth. The medicines protect your baby from infection from any HIV that passed from you during childbirth. Which medicine your baby gets depends on several factors, including what your viral load was just before you gave birth. Your baby will need to take medicines for 4 to 6 weeks. He or she will get several HIV tests over the first few months. Not breastfeeding. Breast milk can have HIV in it. In the United States, infant formula is safe and readily available.

This prevents HIV from copying itself, which reduces the amount of HIV in the body. Several types of medicines do this: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) block an enzyme called reverse transcriptase Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) bind to and later change reverse transcriptase Integrase inhibitors , also called integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), block an enzyme called integrase Protease inhibitors (PIs) block an enzyme called protease Some types of HIV medicines interfere with HIV's ability to infect CD4 immune system cells: Fusion inhibitors block HIV from entering the cells CCR5 antagonists and post-attachment inhibitors block different molecules on the CD4 cells. To infect a cell, HIV has to bind to two types of molecules on the cell's surface. Blocking either of these molecules prevents HIV from entering the cells. Attachment inhibitors bind to a specific protein on the outer surface of HIV. This prevents HIV from entering the cell. Pharmacokinetic enhancers are another type of medicine. They are sometimes taken along with certain other HIV medicines. Pharmacokinetic enhancers increase the effectiveness of the other medicine. They work by slowing the breakdown of the other medicine. This allows that medicine to stay in the body longer at a higher concentration. There are also multidrug combinations , which include a combination of two or more different types of HIV medicines."

                "There are many different things you can do to improve your mental health, including: Staying positive. It's important to try to have a positive outlook; some ways to do that include: Finding balance between positive and negative emotions.  Staying positive doesn't mean that you never feel negative emotions, such as sadness or anger. You need to feel them so that you can move through difficult situations. They can help you to respond to a problem. But you don't want those emotions to take over. For example, it's not helpful to keep thinking about bad things that happened in the past or worry too much about the future. Trying to hold on to the positive emotions when you have them Taking a break from negative information. Know when to stop watching or reading the news. Use social media to reach out for support and feel connected to others but be careful. Don't fall for rumors, get into arguments, or negatively compare your life to others. Practicing gratitude , which means being thankful for the good things in your life. It's helpful to do this every day, either by thinking about what you are grateful for or writing it down in a journal. These can be big things, such as the support you have from loved ones, or little things, such as enjoying a nice meal. It's important to allow yourself a moment to enjoy that you had the positive experience.  Practicing gratitude can help you to see your life differently. For example, when you are stressed, you may not notice that there are also moments when you have some positive emotions. Gratitude can help you to recognize them. Taking care of your physical health , since your physical and mental health are connected. Some ways to take care of your physical health include: Being physically active . Exercise can reduce feelings of stress and depression and improve your mood. Getting enough sleep . Sleep affects your mood. If you don't get a good sleep, you may become more easily annoyed and angry. Over the long term, a lack of quality sleep can make you more likely to become depressed. So it's important to make sure that you have a regular sleep schedule and get enough quality sleep every night. Healthy eating . Good nutrition will help you feel better physically but could also improve your mood and decrease anxiety and stress. Also, not having enough of certain nutrients may contribute to some mental illnesses. For example, there may be a link between low levels of vitamin B12 and depression. Eating a well-balanced diet can help you to get enough of the nutrients you need. Connecting with others. Humans are social creatures, and it's important to have strong, healthy relationships with others. Having good social support may help protect you against the harms of stress. It is also good to have different types of connections. Besides connecting with family and friends, you could find ways to get involved with your community or neighborhood. For example, you could volunteer for a local organization or join a group that is focused on a hobby you enjoy. Developing a sense of meaning and purpose in life. This could be through your job, volunteering, learning new skills, or exploring your spirituality. Developing coping skills , which are methods you use to deal with stressful situations. They may help you face a problem, take action, be flexible, and not easily give up in solving it. Meditation , which is a mind and body practice where you learn to focus your attention and awareness. There are many types, including mindfulness meditation and transcendental meditation. Meditation usually involves: A quiet location with as few distractions as possible A specific, comfortable posture. This could be sitting, lying down, walking, or another position. A focus of attention, such as a specially chosen word or set of words, an object, or your breathing An open attitude, where you try to let distractions come and go naturally without judging them Relaxation techniques are practices you do to produce your body's natural relaxation response. This slows down your breathing, lowers your blood pressure, and reduces muscle tension and stress. Types of relaxation techniques include: Progressive relaxation, where you tighten and relax different muscle groups, sometimes while using mental imagery or breathing exercises Guided imagery, where you learn to focus on positive images in your mind, to help you feel more relaxed and focused Biofeedback, where you use electronic devices to learn to control certain body functions, such as breathing, heart rate, and muscle tension Self-hypnosis, where the goal is to get yourself into a relaxed, trance-like state when you hear a certain suggestion or see a specific cue Deep breathing exercises, which involve focusing on taking slow, deep, even breaths It's also important to recognize when you need to get help. Talk therapy and/or medicines can treat mental disorders . If you don't know where to get treatment, start by contacting your primary care provider."

But if you have too much of it in your blood, it can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or even block them. This puts you at risk for coronary artery disease and other heart diseases . Cholesterol is made by your liver. It travels through the blood on proteins called lipoproteins. One type of lipoprotein, LDL , is sometimes called the \"bad\" cholesterol.

                "The main treatments for high cholesterol are lifestyle changes and medicines. Lifestyle changes to lower cholesterol Heart-healthy lifestyle changes that can help you lower or control your cholesterol include: Heart-healthy eating. A heart-healthy eating plan limits the amount of saturated and trans fats that you eat. It recommends that you eat and drink only enough calories to stay at a healthy weight and avoid weight gain. It also encourages you to choose a variety of nutritious foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. Examples of eating plans that can lower your cholesterol include the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet and the DASH eating plan . Aiming for a healthy weight . If you are overweight or have obesity , losing weight can help lower your LDL cholesterol and raise your HDL cholesterol. This is especially important for people with metabolic syndrome . Metabolic syndrome is a group of conditions that together raise your risk of heart diseases and other health problems. Getting regular physical activity . Studies have shown that physical activity can lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and raise your HDL cholesterol.  Before you start an exercise program, ask your health care provider what level of physical activity is right for you. Managing stress . Research has shown that chronic stress can sometimes raise your LDL cholesterol and lower your HDL cholesterol. Quitting smoking . Quitting smoking can raise your HDL cholesterol. Since HDL helps to remove LDL cholesterol from your arteries, having more HDL can help to lower your LDL cholesterol. Getting enough good-quality sleep . Getting 7 to 9 hours of sleep every night lowers your risk of high LDL  cholesterol and total cholesterol levels. Medicines to lower cholesterol For some people, making lifestyle changes alone does not their lower cholesterol enough. They may also need to take cholesterol medicines . There are several types. They work in different ways and can have different side effects . If your provider recommends that you take cholesterol medicines, ask them which medicine would be right for you. Even if you take medicines to lower your cholesterol, you still need to continue with lifestyle changes."

                "Some other possible treatments for high cholesterol may include: Lipoprotein apheresis to lower cholesterol Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited condition that causes very high levels of cholesterol in the blood. Some people who have FH may get a treatment called lipoprotein apheresis. This treatment uses a filtering machine to remove LDL cholesterol from your blood. Then the machine returns the rest of your blood back to your body. Supplements to lower cholesterol Many companies sell supplements that they say can lower cholesterol. For many of these supplements, there isn't enough evidence to show that they can lower cholesterol levels. But for some supplements, research has found that they have cholesterol-lowering effects. For example: Plant stanols and sterols supplements, when taken with meals, can reduce cholesterol levels. Some soy products have a small cholesterol-lowering effect. But research has found that eating soy foods gives you more of a benefit than taking supplements. Whole flaxseed and flaxseed lignans may help to lower cholesterol levels. However, flaxseed oil does not. Garlic supplements may lower cholesterol levels, but the effect is small when compared to the effects of cholesterol medicines. Supplements may cause side effects and interactions with medicines. Always check with your provider before you take any supplements."

                "Heart-healthy lifestyle changes include a diet to lower your cholesterol. The DASH eating plan is one example. Another is the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet, which recommends that you: Choose healthier fats. You should limit both total fat and saturated fat. No more than 25 to 35% of your daily calories should come from dietary fats , and less than 7% of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Depending upon how many calories you eat per day, here are the maximum amounts of saturated fats that you should eat: Calories per Day Saturated Fat 1,200 8 grams 1,500 10 grams 2,000 13 grams 2,500 17 grams  Saturated fat is a bad fat because it raises your LDL (bad cholesterol) level more than anything else in your diet. It is found in some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods. Instead of saturated fats, switch to foods with healthier fats, such as lean meat, nuts, and unsaturated oils like canola, olive, and safflower oils. Limit foods with cholesterol. If you are trying to lower your cholesterol, you should have less than 200 mg a day of cholesterol. Cholesterol is in foods from animals, such as liver and other organ meats, egg yolks, shrimp, and whole milk dairy products. Eat plenty of soluble fiber . Soluble fiber helps prevent your digestive tract from absorbing cholesterol. You should try to get 10 to 25 grams of it per day. Foods that are high in soluble fiber include: Whole-grain cereals such as oatmeal and oat bran Fruits such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes Legumes such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans Eat lots of fruits and vegetables. They are important sources of vitamins, fiber, and other nutrients. Increase plant stanols and sterols in your diet. These are substances that also help prevent your digestive tract from absorbing cholesterol. You should try to get 2 grams of them per day. They can be found in whole grains, nuts, legumes, and oils, such as olive oil and avocado oil. They are also added to some foods, such as certain types of orange juice, margarine, and bread. Eat foods that are high in omega-3 fatty acids. These special fats can lower LDL and triglyceride levels. They can also help control blood pressure and may lower your risk of heart rhythm problems . If you have heart disease, they may lower your risk of heart attack .  Omega-3 fatty acids can be found in: Fish such as salmon, tuna (canned or fresh), and mackerel. Most people should try to eat these fish two times a week. But if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, you should avoid fish that could be high in mercury , such as mackerel. Plant sources such as walnuts, flaxseed, chia seeds, and canola and soybean oils. But they have smaller amounts of omega-3 acids than the fish sources. Fortified foods, such as certain brands of eggs, yogurt, juices, milk, soy beverages, and infant formulas. Limit salt. You should try to limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat to no more than 2,300 milligrams (about 1 teaspoon of salt) a day. That includes all the sodium you eat, whether it's added in cooking, used at the table, or already present in food products. Limiting salt won't lower your cholesterol, but it can lower your risk of heart diseases by helping to lower your blood pressure . You can reduce your sodium by instead choosing low-salt and \"no added salt\" foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Limit alcohol . Alcohol adds extra calories, which can lead to weight gain. Being overweight can raise your LDL level and lower your HDL level. Too much alcohol can also increase your risk of heart diseases because it can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride level. It's best not to drink, but if you do: Have no more than 2 drinks per day if you are a man Have no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman Nutrition labels can help you figure out how much fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, fiber, and sodium is in the foods that you buy. This can help you eat healthier and lower your cholesterol. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"

The changes are: Losing weight and keeping it off. Weight control is an important part of diabetes prevention. You may be able to prevent or delay diabetes by losing 5 to 10% of your current weight. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds, your goal would be to lose between 10 to 20 pounds. And once you lose the weight, it is important that you don't gain it back. Following a healthy eating plan. It is important to reduce the amount of calories you eat and drink each day, so you can lose weight and keep it off. To do that, your diet should include smaller portions and less fat and sugar. You should also eat a variety of foods from each food group, including plenty of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. It's also a good idea to limit red meat, and avoid processed meats.

                "There are many heart disease risk factors that you can change.  If you make these changes, you don't just help protect your heart. You can also improve your overall health and well-being. You may have a lot of changes to make. If you need to, you can make the changes gradually, one at a time. What's most important is that you make them. Depending on your lifestyle, these changes could include: Controlling your blood pressure. High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease. It is important to get your blood pressure checked regularly - at least once a year for most adults, and more often if you have high blood pressure. You can also take steps, including lifestyle changes, to prevent or control high blood pressure. Keeping your cholesterol and triglyceride levels under control: High levels of cholesterol can clog your arteries and raise your risk of coronary artery disease and heart attack . Lifestyle changes and medicines (if needed) can lower your cholesterol. Triglycerides are another type of fat in the blood. High  levels of triglyceride may also raise the risk of coronary artery disease, especially in women. Staying at a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity can increase your risk of heart disease. This is mostly because they are linked to other heart disease risk factors, including high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Controlling your weight can lower these risks. Eating a healthy diet. Try to limit saturated fats , foods high in sodium (salt), and added sugars . Instead, eat plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables, and whole grains. The DASH diet is an example of an eating plan that can help you to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol, two things that can lower your risk of heart disease. Getting regular physical activity. Regular physical activity has many benefits, including strengthening your heart and improving your circulation. It can also help you maintain a healthy weight and lower cholesterol and blood pressure. All of these can lower your risk of heart disease. Limiting alcohol . Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Both of those raise your risk of heart disease. It's best not to drink, but if you do: Have no more than 2 drinks per day if you are a man. Have no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman. Not smoking . Cigarette smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk of heart attack and stroke . If you do not smoke, don't start. If you do smoke, quitting will lower your risk of heart disease. You can talk with your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit. Managing stress. Stress is linked to heart disease in many ways. It can raise your blood pressure. Extreme stress can be a \"trigger\" for a heart attack. Also, some common ways of coping with stress, such as overeating, heavy drinking, and smoking, are bad for your heart. Some ways to help manage your stress include exercise, listening to music, focusing on something calm or peaceful, and meditating. Managing diabetes. Having diabetes doubles your risk of diabetic heart disease . That is because over time, high blood glucose (blood sugar) from diabetes can damage your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels. So, it is important to get tested for diabetes , and if you have it, to keep it under control. Getting enough sleep. If you don't get enough sleep, you raise your risk of high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes. Those three things can raise your risk of heart disease. To improve your sleep: If you are an adult, try to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night. Make sure that you have good sleep habits , such as keeping a regular sleep schedule and creating a good sleeping environment in your bedroom. If you have frequent sleep problems , contact your health care provider. One problem, sleep apnea , causes people to briefly stop breathing many times during sleep. This interferes with your ability to get a good rest and can raise your risk of heart disease. If you think you might have sleep apnea, ask your provider about having a sleep study . And if you do have sleep apnea, make sure that you get treatment for it."

                "Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into your arteries (the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to the tissues and organs in your body). Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Blood pressure is measured as two numbers: Systolic pressure (the first and higher number) measures pressure inside your arteries when your heart beats Diastolic pressure (the second and lower number) measures the pressure inside your arteries when your heart rests between beats As an example, a blood pressure reading of 120/80 means a systolic of 120 and a diastolic of 80."

                "Anyone can develop high blood pressure, but there are certain factors that can increase your risk: Age. Blood pressure tends to rise with age. Race/Ethnicity . High blood pressure is more common in Black adults. They also tend to have higher average blood pressure numbers and get high blood pressure earlier in life. Sex. Men are more likely than women to develop high blood pressure throughout middle age. But in older adults, women are more likely than men to develop high blood pressure. Lifestyle. Certain lifestyle habits can raise your risk for high blood pressure, such as eating too much sodium (salt) or not enough potassium , lack of exercise , drinking too much alcohol , and smoking . Family history and genetics . High blood pressure often runs in families. Many genes are linked to small increases in high blood pressure risk. Social and economic factors: Research shows that factors such as income, education level, where you live, and the type of job you have may raise your risk of high blood pressure. For example, working early or late shifts can raise your risk. Experiencing discrimination and poverty has been linked to high blood pressure. Also, some research has shown that trauma in childhood may raise the risk of high blood pressure. Certain medicines. Some medicines can raise your blood pressure, including: Certain antidepressants Decongestants (medicines to relieve a stuffy nose) Hormonal birth control pills Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are a type of pain reliever Having certain other medical conditions, such as: Some tumors Chronic kidney disease Diabetes Metabolic syndrome Overweight and obesity Sleep apnea Thyroid problems"

To help manage your blood pressure, you should limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat and increase the amount of potassium in your diet. It is also important to eat foods that are lower in fat, as well as plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The DASH eating plan is an example of an eating plan that can help you to lower your blood pressure. Getting regular physical activity . Regular physical activity can help you maintain a healthy weight and lower your blood pressure. Being at a healthy weight . Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk for high blood pressure. Maintaining a healthy weight can help you control high blood pressure and reduce your risk for other health problems. Limiting alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Not smoking. Cigarette smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk for heart attack and stroke. If you do not smoke, don't start. If you do smoke, talk to yourprovider for help in finding the best way for you to quit . Managing stress . Learning how to relax and manage stress can improve your emotional and physical health and lower high blood pressure. Stress management techniques include exercising, listening to music, focusing on something calm or peaceful, and meditating. Getting enough high-quality sleep . If you already have high blood pressure, it is important to prevent it from getting worse or causing complications. You need to get regular medical care and follow your treatment plan.

About 40 of them are spread through direct sexual contact with someone who has the virus. They can also spread through other intimate, skin-to-skin contact. Some of these types can cause cancer. There are two categories of sexually transmitted HPV. Low-risk HPV can cause warts on or around your genitals , anus, mouth, or throat. High-risk HPV can cause various cancers: Cervical cancer Anal cancer Some types of oral and throat cancer Vulvar cancer Vaginal cancer Penile cancer Most HPV infections go away on their own and don't cause cancer. But sometimes the infections last longer. When a high-risk HPV infection lasts for many years, it can lead to cell changes.

The symptoms of DKA may include: Trouble breathing Nausea or vomiting Pain in your abdomen (belly) Confusion Feeling very tired or sleepy If you have an an at-home test for ketones, check your ketone level every 4 to 6 hours when your blood glucose is very high or when you are having these symptoms.

You probably need to take the medicines for 1 to 2 years. In some cases, you might need to take the medicines for several years. This is the simplest treatment, but it is often not a permanent cure. Beta blocker medicines, which can reduce symptoms such as tremors, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness. They work quickly and can help you feel better until other treatments take effect. Radioiodine therapy is a common and effective treatment for hyperthyroidism. It involves taking radioactive iodine by mouth as a capsule or liquid. This slowly destroys the cells of the thyroid gland that produce thyroid hormone. It does not affect other body tissues. Almost everyone who has radioactive iodine treatment later develops hypothyroidism. This is because the thyroid hormone-producing cells have been destroyed. But hypothyroidism is easier to treat and causes fewer long-term health problems than hyperthyroidism. Surgery to remove part or most of the thyroid gland is done in rare cases. It might be an option for people with large goiters or pregnant women who cannot take antithyroid medicines. If you have all of your thyroid removed, you will need to take thyroid medicines for the rest of your life. Some people who have part of their thyroid removed also need to take medicines. If you have hyperthyroidism, it's important not to get too much iodine. Talk to your health care provider about which foods, supplements, and medicines you need to avoid.

About 6 to 8 weeks after you start taking the medicine, you will get a blood test to check your thyroid hormone level. Your health care provider will adjust your dose if needed. Each time your dose is adjusted, you'll have another blood test. Once you find the right dose, you will probably get a blood test in 6 months. After that, you will need the test once a year. If you take your medicine according to the instructions, you usually should be able to control the hypothyroidism. You should never stop taking your medicine without talking with your health care provider first. If you have Hashimoto's disease or other types of autoimmune thyroid disorders, you may be sensitive to harmful side effects from iodine. Talk to your health care provider about which foods, supplements, and medicines you need to avoid. Women need more iodine when they are pregnant because the baby gets iodine from the mother's diet. If you are pregnant, talk with your health care provider about how much iodine you need. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"

                "Your immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs. Together they help the body fight infections and other diseases. When germs such as bacteria or viruses invade your body, they attack and multiply. This is called an infection. The infection causes the disease that makes you sick. Your immune system protects you from the disease by fighting off the germs."

They make mucus and other substances which can trap and fight germs. White blood cells, which fight germs Organs and tissues of the lymph system , such as the thymus, spleen , tonsils, lymph nodes, lymph vessels, and bone marrow .  They produce, store, and carry white blood cells."

                "How does the immune system work?",
                "Your immune system defends your body against substances it sees as harmful or foreign. These substances are called antigens. They may be germs such as bacteria and viruses. They might be chemicals or toxins. They could also be cells that are damaged from things like cancer or sunburn . When your immune system recognizes an antigen, it attacks it. This is called an immune response. Part of this response is to make antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that work to attack, weaken, and destroy antigens. Your body also makes other cells to fight the antigen. Afterwards, your immune system remembers the antigen. If it sees the antigen again, it can recognize it. It will quickly send out the right antibodies, so in most cases, you don't get sick. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity."
            ],
            [
                "What are the types of immunity?",
                "There are three different types of immunity: Innate immunity is the protection that you are born with. It is your body's first line of defense. It includes barriers such as the skin and mucous membranes. They keep harmful substances from entering the body. It also includes some cells and chemicals which can attack foreign substances. Active immunity , also called adaptive immunity, develops when you are infected with or vaccinated against a foreign substance. Active immunity is usually long-lasting. For many diseases, it can last your entire life. Passive immunity happens when you receive antibodies to a disease instead of making them through your own immune system. For example, newborn babies have antibodies from their mothers. People can also get passive immunity through blood products that contain antibodies. This kind of immunity gives you protection right away. But it only lasts a few weeks or months."

                "What can go wrong with the immune system?",
                "Sometimes a person may have an immune response even though there is no real threat. This can lead to problems such as allergies , asthma , and autoimmune diseases . If you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. Other immune system problems happen when your immune system does not work correctly. These problems include immunodeficiency diseases. If you have an immunodeficiency disease, you get sick more often. Your infections may last longer and can be more serious and harder to treat. They are often genetic disorders . There are other diseases that can affect your immune system. For example, HIV is a virus that harms your immune system by destroying your white blood cells. If HIV is not treated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). People with AIDS have badly damaged immune systems. They get an increasing number of severe illnesses."

Most people get an EBV infection at some point in their lives, but only some of them will get the symptoms of mono. EBV infections often happen during childhood or when someone is a young adult. EBV infections in children usually do not cause symptoms. And when they do, it's hard to tell the difference between the symptoms of mono and the symptoms of other common childhood illnesses such as the flu . Teens and young adults who get EBV are more likely to have symptoms that are typical of mono. EBV and the other viruses that cause mono are usually spread through body fluids, especially saliva (spit). This means that you can get it through kissing. That's why mono is sometimes called \"the kissing disease.\" But you can also get these viruses if you share food, drinks, forks, spoons, or lip balm with someone who has mono.

If you have severe symptoms, your provider may suggest additional treatment based on which organs in your body are affected by the mono. Antibiotics don't treat viral infections, so they do not help with mono. Some people do get bacterial infections such as strep throat along with mono. In that case, you probably need antibiotics to treat the bacterial infection. But you should not take penicillin antibiotics like ampicillin or amoxicillin. Those antibiotics can cause a rash in people who have mono. Mono can cause an enlarged spleen, which could rupture and cause a medical emergency. To try to protect the spleen, providers recommend avoiding intense exercise and contact sports until you fully recover (about a month)."

The bursa is a small fluid-filled sac. It works as a pad between the bones of a joint and the moving parts around it, such as muscles, tendons and skin. With bursitis, the bursa becomes irritated and swollen with extra fluid. Overuse is the most common cause, but injuries, infections and other conditions, such as arthritis, can cause bursitis. Tendinitis . This condition happens when you overuse a tendon. It swells and makes the joint painful to move. Chronic strain. A strain becomes chronic when your muscles or tendons stretch or tear slowly over time from repeating the same movements. The treatments for bursitis, tendinitis, and chronic strain are often the same. They usually include rest, keeping the injured joint higher than your heart, and taking medicine to reduce swelling. Your provider may recommend gentle exercise and other treatment. In some cases, your provider may suggest an injection (a shot) of medicine into the joint.

Normally, you're born with a set of 46 chromosomes in each cell, two of which are the sex chromosomes. Females usually have two X chromosomes (XX), and males usually have one X and one Y (XY). In KS, the male usually has two X chromosomes and one Y (XXY). In rare cases, a male could have XY in some cells and XXY in other cells. This is called mosaic Klinefelter syndrome.

You may need a knee replacement if you have knee damage that causes severe pain and difficulty doing daily activities, such as walking and climbing stairs. It is usually done when other treatments for knee pain haven't helped enough. The goal of a knee replacement is to relieve pain and help you move better. People of all ages may have knee replacement surgery. But it is more common in older people. The decision whether to have surgery is based on your overall health and how much your knee bothers you."

Healthy cartilage is smooth and helps the bones glide over each other when you move. When cartilage becomes rough and wears away, the bones rub against each other, causing pain. After removing the damaged knee cartilage and bone, the surgeon attaches the artificial parts to your bones. The artificial parts are made of metal and plastic. They will give your knee new, smooth surfaces. Knee replacement surgery may replace all the damaged parts of your knee (total knee replacement) or just part of your knee (partial knee replacement). In a total knee replacement, the surgeon replaces 3 surfaces: The end of the shinbone The end of the thighbone The back of the kneecap"

To help prevent blood clots , you'll most likely take blood thinners and wear special socks or coverings on your legs for a short time after surgery. The success of your surgery depends a lot on what you do at home to help yourself recover. A physical therapist will teach you exercises to make your knee stronger and help it bend. It is important to do these exercises regularly. You may need to use a cane or walker for several weeks after the surgery. It will probably also be several weeks before you can drive. Your doctor will tell you when you can start driving again.

Before the age of menopause, women have lower total cholesterol levels than men of the same age. After the age of menopause, women's LDL levels tend to rise. Genetics. Your genes partly determine how much cholesterol your body makes. High cholesterol can run in families. For example, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited form of high blood cholesterol. Medicines. Certain medicines, including steroids , some blood pressure medicines , and HIV medicines , can raise your LDL level. Other medical conditions. Diseases such as chronic kidney disease , diabetes, and HIV can cause a higher LDL level. Race or ethnicity.

If lifestyle changes alone do not lower your LDL level enough, you may also need to take medicines. There are several types of cholesterol-lowering drugs available, including statins . The medicines work in different ways and can have different side effects. Talk to your provider about which one is right for you.  While you are taking medicines to lower your LDL level, you still should continue with the lifestyle changes.

Dementia is a loss of mental functions that is severe enough to affect your daily life and activities. These functions include: Memory Language skills Visual perception (your ability to make sense of what you see) Problem solving Trouble with everyday tasks The ability to focus and pay attention"

                "There are two types of LBD: dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia. Both types cause the same changes in the brain. And, over time, they can cause similar symptoms. The main difference is in when the cognitive (thinking) and movement symptoms start. Dementia with Lewy bodies causes problems with thinking ability that seem similar to Alzheimer's disease . Later, it also causes other symptoms, such as movement symptoms, visual hallucinations, and certain sleep disorders . It also causes more trouble with mental activities than with memory. Parkinson's disease dementia starts as a movement disorder. It first causes the symptoms of Parkinson's disease : slowed movement, muscle stiffness, tremor, and a shuffling walk. Later on, it causes dementia."

                "LBD happens when Lewy bodies build up in parts of the brain that control memory, thinking, and movement.  Lewy bodies are abnormal deposits of a protein called alpha-synuclein. Researchers don't know exactly why these deposits form. But they do know that other diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, also involve a build-up of that protein."

                "LBD is a progressive disease. This means that the symptoms start slowly and get worse over time. The most common symptoms include changes in cognition, movement, sleep, and behavior: Dementia , which is a loss of mental functions that is severe enough to affect your daily life and activities Changes in concentration, attention, alertness, and wakefulness. These changes usually happen from day to day. But sometimes they can also happen throughout the same day. Visual hallucinations , which means seeing things that are not there Problems with movement and posture , including slowness of movement, difficulty walking, and muscle stiffness. These are called parkinsonian motor symptoms. REM sleep behavior disorder , a condition in which a person seems to act out dreams. It may include vivid dreaming, talking in one's sleep, violent movements, or falling out of bed. This may be the earliest symptom of LBD in some people. It can appear several years before any other LBD symptoms. Changes in behavior and mood , such as depression , anxiety , and apathy (a lack of interest in normal daily activities or events) In the early stages of LBD, symptoms can be mild, and people can function fairly normally. As the disease gets worse, people with LBD need more help due to problems with thinking and movement. In the later stages of the disease, they often cannot care for themselves."

The doctor will: Do a medical history, including taking a detailed account of the symptoms. The doctor will talk to both the patient and caregivers. Do physical and neurological exams Do tests to rule out other conditions that could cause similar symptoms. These could include blood tests and brain imaging tests . Do neuropsychological tests to evaluate memory and other cognitive functions LBD can be hard to diagnose, because Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease cause similar symptoms. Scientists think that Lewy body disease might be related to these diseases, or that they sometimes happen together. It's also important to know which type of LBD a person has, so the doctor can treat that type's particular symptoms. It also helps the doctor understand how the disease will affect the person over time. The doctor makes a diagnosis based on when certain symptoms start: If cognitive symptoms start within a year of movement problems, the diagnosis is dementia with Lewy bodies If cognitive problems start more than a year after the movement problems, the diagnosis is Parkinson's disease dementia"

It can also help them plan for the future. Music or art therapy may reduce anxiety and improve well-being Support groups can also be helpful for people with LBD and their caregivers.

Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The more years you smoke and the more cigarettes you smoke each day, the more your risk goes up.  Your risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked. Secondhand smoke , which is the combination of the smoke that comes from a cigarette and the smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you breathe in secondhand smoke, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts. A family history of lung cancer. Being exposed to asbestos , arsenic , chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace. Being exposed to radiation , for example from: Radiation therapy to the breast or chest Radon in the home or workplace Certain imaging tests such as CT scans HIV infection . Your risk is higher if you have HIV. However, smoking rates are higher in people who have HIV, so it's not clear whether the increased risk is from the HIV infection or from smoking. Air pollution .

The signs can include breast pain, thickening of the skin of the breast, nipple discharge, or a change in breast size or shape.

The plates press your breast and make it flat. This may be uncomfortable, but it helps get a clear picture. You will get both breasts x-rayed from the front and from the side. Afterwards, a radiologist (a doctor with special training) will read the mammogram. The doctor will look at the x-ray for early signs of breast cancer or other problems. You will usually get the results within a few weeks, although it depends on the clinic or medical office that you went to. If your results are not normal, you should hear back earlier. Contact your provider or the office where you had the mammogram if you do not receive a report of your results within 30 days."

You may also be referred to a breast specialist or a surgeon. But it does not necessarily mean you have cancer or need surgery. You would see one of these doctors because they are experts in diagnosing breast problems."

Lighter or heavier. Hot flashes, a sudden warm feeling in your face, neck, and chest. They may cause you to sweat . If they happen at night and cause sweating, they are called night sweats.

You may want to carry a portable fan to use when you get a hot flash. Avoid alcohol , spicy foods, and caffeine . They can make your menopause symptoms worse. If you smoke, try to quit , not only for hot flashes, but for your overall health. Try to maintain a healthy weight . Being overweight or having obesity can make hot flashes worse.

Lower stress , for example by using relaxation techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, and muscle relaxation exercises.

Non-hormone treatments There are various non-hormone treatments for menopause symptoms, such as: Medicines for hot flashes, including certain antidepressants , a medicine just for hot flashes, an antiseizure medicine, and a blood pressure medicine . Some of these medicines may also help with sleep problems. Medicines for urinary incontinence. Medicines to treat or help prevent osteoporosis. Low-dose birth control pills for very heavy bleeding or periods that are close together. Water-based lubricants to treat vaginal dryness. Medicines for painful intercourse that is caused by vaginal changes from menopause. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a type of talk therapy, for trouble sleeping. Hormone treatments  Like all medicines, MHT has benefits and risks. Talk with your provider about whether it is safe for you. If you decide to take MHT, your provider may recommend taking the lowest dose that works for the shortest time needed. Supplements, herbs, and \"natural\" hormone creams There are various products that are marketed for menopause symptoms. They include supplements , herbs , and over-the-counter \"natural\" hormone creams. There has been research on many of these products. So far, none of them has clearly been shown to be helpful. Also, there is little information on the long-term safety of these products. Some supplements can have harmful side effects or interact with medicines.

Biofeedback uses electronic devices to teach you to control certain body functions, such as your heartbeat, blood pressure, and muscle tension. Make a log of what seems to trigger your migraines. You can learn what you need to avoid, such as certain foods and medicines. It also help you figure out what you should do, such as establishing a consistent sleep schedule and eating regular meals. Hormone therapy may help some women whose migraines seem to be linked to their menstrual cycle If you have obesity , losing weight may also be helpful If you have frequent or severe migraines, you may need to take medicines to prevent further attacks. Talk with your health care provider about which drug would be right for you. Certain natural treatments, such as riboflavin (vitamin B2) and coenzyme Q10, may help prevent migraines. If your magnesium level is low, you can try taking magnesium. There is also an herb, butterbur, which some people take to prevent migraines. But butterbur may not be safe for long-term use.

The flaps make sure that blood flows in the right direction through your heart and to the rest of your body. When your heart beats, the flaps open to let blood through. Between heartbeats, they close to stop the blood from flowing backwards. The mitral valve opens to let blood flow from your heart's upper left chamber to the lower left chamber. When the lower left chamber contracts (squeezes) to pump blood to your body, the mitral valve closes tightly to keep any blood from flowing backwards."

For example, if sleep problems affect you the most, you might first try using good sleep habits . If those do not help, you may need to take medicines or see a sleep specialist. Strategies such as learning new ways to manage activity can also be helpful. You need to make sure that you do not \"push and crash.\" This can happen when you feel better, do too much, and then get worse again. When you have ME/CFS, it can be hard to help develop a treatment plan. It can also be difficult to  try to take care of yourself.  So it's important that you have support from family members and friends. There are also various resources and strategies that might be helpful to you, such as: Getting counseling to help you cope with the illness and its impact on your life. Eating a healthy diet. Nutritional supplements, if your provider suggests them. Complementary therapies such as meditation, gentle massage, or relaxation therapy. Make sure to talk to your provider before you try any new treatments. Some treatments that are promoted as cures for ME/CFS are unproven, often costly, and could be dangerous.

                "Myasthenia gravis is caused by an error in how nerve signals are sent to muscles. These signals get blocked at the nerve-muscle junction. This junction is the place where the nerve endings connect with the muscles they control. Normally, this is how the signals work: The signals travel down a nerve that controls movement in the muscle The nerve endings release a substance called acetylcholine Acetylcholine binds to the muscle tissue at the nerve-muscle junction This causes the muscle to contract (move) But in someone with myasthenia gravis, the body's own immune system makes antibodies that block the binding of acetylcholine to the muscle. This makes the muscles weaker. The thymus gland, which is part of your immune system, may play a role in myasthenia gravis. Normally, your thymus gland is active and growing when you are a child. It makes white blood cells to fight infections. At puberty, it starts getting smaller and is replaced by fat. It is usually small by the time you are an adult. But in many adults with myasthenia gravis, the thymus gland stays large. And some people with myasthenia gravis can get thymomas, which are tumors of the thymus.

                "Many non-drug treatments can help with pain. It is important to check with your health care provider before trying any of them: Acupuncture involves stimulating acupuncture points. These are specific points on your body. There are different acupuncture methods. The most common one involves inserting thin needles through the skin. Others include using pressure, electrical stimulation, and heat. Acupuncture is based on the belief that qi (vital energy) flows through the body along paths, called meridians. Practitioners believe that triggering the acupuncture points can rebalance the qi. Research suggests that acupuncture can help manage certain pain conditions. Biofeedback techniques use electronic devices to measure body functions such as breathing and heart rate. This teaches you to be more aware of your body functions so you can learn to control them. For example, a biofeedback device may show you measurements of your muscle tension. By watching how these measurements change, you can become more aware of when your muscles are tense and learn to relax them. Biofeedback may help to control pain, including chronic headaches and back pain. Electrical stimulation involves using a device to send a gentle electric current to your nerves or muscles. This can help treat pain by changing or blocking pain signals. Types include: Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) Implanted electric nerve stimulation Deep brain or spinal cord stimulation Massage therapy is a treatment in which the soft tissues of the body are kneaded, rubbed, tapped, and stroked. Among other benefits, it may help people relax, and relieve stress and pain. Meditation is a mind-body practice in which you focus your attention on something, such as an object, word, phrase, or breathing. This helps you to minimize distracting or stressful thoughts or feelings. Physical therapy uses techniques such as heat, cold, exercise, massage, and manipulation. It can help to control pain, condition muscles and restore strength. Psychotherapy (talk therapy) uses methods such as discussion, listening, and counseling to treat mental and behavioral disorders. It can also help people who have pain, especially chronic pain, by: Teaching them coping skills to better deal with the stress that pain can cause Addressing negative thoughts and emotions that can make pain worse Providing them with support Relaxation therapy can help reduce muscle tension and stress, lower blood pressure, and control pain. It may involve tensing and relaxing muscles throughout the body. It may be used with guided imagery (focusing the mind on positive images) and meditation. Surgery can sometimes be necessary to treat severe pain, especially when back problems or serious musculoskeletal injuries cause it. There are always risks to getting surgery, and it does not always work to treat pain. It is important to go through all the risks and benefits with your provider."

Several different types of bacteria can cause pneumonia, including: Streptococcus pneumoniae Legionella pneumophila ; this type of pneumonia is often called Legionnaires' disease Mycoplasma pneumoniae Chlamydia pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) Viruses that infect the respiratory tract may cause pneumonia. Viral pneumonia is often mild and goes away on its own within a few weeks. But sometimes it is serious enough that you need to get treatment in a hospital. If you have viral pneumonia, you are at risk of also getting bacterial pneumonia. The different viruses that can cause pneumonia include: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Some common cold and flu viruses SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 Fungal pneumonia is more common in people who have chronic health problems or weakened immune systems . Some of the types include: <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia (PCP) Valley fever (Coccidioidomycosis) Histoplasmosis Cryptococcal pneumonia Aspiration can also cause pneumonia. It can happen when you aspirate (accidentally breathe in) food or fluid into the lungs. If you are not able to cough out the food or fluid, it may cause an infection."

Examples include Flashbacks, which cause you to feel like you are going through the event again Nightmares Frightening thoughts Avoidance symptoms , when you try to avoid situations or people that trigger memories of the traumatic event. This may cause you to Stay away from places, events, or objects that are reminders of the traumatic experience. For example, if you were in a car accident, you might stop driving. Avoiding thoughts or feelings related to the traumatic event. For example, you might try to stay very busy to try to avoid thinking about what happened. Arousal and reactivity symptoms , which may cause you to be jittery or be on the lookout for danger. They include Being easily startled Feeling tense or \"on edge\" Having difficulty sleeping Having angry outbursts Cognition and mood symptoms , which are negative changes in beliefs and feelings. They include Trouble remembering important things about the traumatic event Negative thoughts about yourself or the world Feeling blame and guilt No longer being interested in things you enjoyed Trouble concentrating The symptoms usually start soon after the traumatic event. But sometimes they may not appear until months or years later. They also may come and go over many years. If your symptoms last longer than four weeks, cause you great distress, or interfere with your work or home life, you might have PTSD."

Before pregnancy, you need 400 mcg (micrograms) per day. During pregnancy and when breastfeeding, you need 600 mcg per day from foods and/or vitamins. It is hard to get this amount from foods alone, so you will most likely need to take a supplement that contains folic acid. Iron is important for your baby's growth and brain development. During pregnancy, the amount of blood in your body increases, so you need more iron for yourself and your growing baby. You should get 27 mg (milligrams) of iron a day. Calcium during pregnancy can reduce your risk of preeclampsia . It's a serious medical condition that causes a sudden increase in your blood pressure. Calcium also builds up your baby's bones and teeth. Pregnant adults should get 1,000 mg (milligrams) of calcium a day Pregnant teenagers (ages 14-18) need 1,300 mg of calcium a day Vitamin D helps the calcium to build your baby's bones and teeth. All women, pregnant or not, should be getting 600 IU (international units) of vitamin D per day. Keep in mind that taking too much of a supplement can be harmful. For example, very high levels of vitamin A can cause birth defects . Only take vitamins and mineral supplements that your health care provider recommends. You also need more protein when you are pregnant. Healthy sources of protein include beans, peas, eggs, lean meats, seafood, and unsalted nuts and seeds. Getting enough fluids is another special nutritional concern during pregnancy. When you are pregnant, your body needs even more water to stay hydrated and support the life inside you.

You usually take it until about age 50; that's about the age when menopause usually begins. Calcium and vitamin D supplements. Because women with POI are at higher risk for osteoporosis, you should take calcium and vitamin D every day. In vitro fertilization (IVF). If you have POI and you wish to become pregnant, you may consider trying IVF . Regular physical activity and a healthy body weight. Getting regular exercise and controlling your weight can lower your risk for osteoporosis and heart disease. Treatments for associated conditions. If you have a condition that is related to POI, it is important to treat that as well. Treatments may involve medicines and hormones. NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"

Active surveillance means having regular tests to see if your prostate cancer has changed. If the tests show the cancer is starting to grow or if you develop symptoms, then you will have treatment to try to cure the cancer. Surgery to remove your prostate gland may be an option if your cancer hasn't spread outside of your prostate. Radiation therapy uses high energy to kill cancer cells or prevent them from growing. Hormone therapy blocks cancer cells from getting the hormones they need to grow. It may include taking medicines or having surgery to remove the testicles. Chemotherapy uses medicines to kill cancer cells, slow their growth, or stop them from spreading. You might take the drugs by mouth, as an injection (shot), as a cream, or intravenously (by IV).

A vena cava filter may be used in some people who cannot take blood thinners. Your health care provider inserts a filter inside a large vein called the vena cava. The filter catches blood clots before they travel to the lungs, which prevents pulmonary embolism. But the filter does not stop new blood clots from forming."

                "Pulmonary hypertension, sometimes called PH, is a serious condition that affects the blood vessels in the lungs. It develops when the blood pressure in your lungs is higher than normal. Your heart pumps blood to your lungs so they can add oxygen to the blood. The blood goes back to your heart. From there, it travels to the rest of your body so that your tissues can get the oxygen that they need. The blood moves from your heart to your lungs through blood vessels called pulmonary arteries. If the pulmonary arteries become damaged, narrowed, or blocked, the blood does not flow through them as well. This can increase the blood pressure in the arteries and cause pulmonary hypertension. There are different types of pulmonary hypertension, including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The different types are based on what caused the disease."

For example, PR may help you if you: Have COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The two main types are emphysema and chronic bronchitis . In COPD, your airways (tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs) are partially blocked. This makes it hard to get air in and out. Have an interstitial lung disease such as sarcoidosis and pulmonary fibrosis . These diseases cause scarring of the lungs over time. This makes it hard to get enough oxygen. Have cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is an inherited disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to collect in the lungs and block the airways. Need lung surgery. You may have PR before and after lung surgery to help you prepare for and recover from the surgery. Have a muscle-wasting disorder that affects the muscles used for breathing. An example is muscular dystrophy . PR works best if you start it before your disease is severe. However, even people who have advanced lung disease can benefit from PR."

You will have lung function, exercise, and possibly blood tests. Your team will go over your medical history and current treatments. They may check on your mental health and ask about your diet. Then they will work together to create a plan that is right for you. It may include: Exercise training. Your team will come up with an exercise plan to improve your endurance and muscle strength. You will likely have exercises for both your arms and legs. You might use a treadmill, stationary bike, or weights. You may need to start slowly and increase your exercise as you get stronger. Nutritional counseling. Being either overweight or underweight can affect your breathing. A nutritious eating plan can help you work towards a healthy weight. Education about your disease and how to manage it. This includes learning how to avoid situations that make your symptoms worse, how to avoid infections, and how/when to take your medicines. Techniques you can use to save your energy. Your team may teach you easier ways to do daily tasks. For example, you may learn ways to avoid reaching, lifting, or bending. Those movements make it harder to breathe, since they use up energy and make you tighten your abdominal muscles. You may also learn how to better deal with stress , since stress can also take up energy and affect your breathing. Breathing strategies. You will learn techniques to improve your breathing. These techniques may increase your oxygen levels, decrease how often you take breaths, and keep your airways open longer. Psychological counseling and/or group support. It can feel scary to have trouble breathing. If you have a chronic lung disease, you are more likely to have depression , anxiety , or other emotional problems. Many PR programs include counseling and/or support groups. If not, your PR team may be able to refer you to an organization that offers them. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"

When your child swallows, this muscle relaxes to let food pass from the esophagus to the stomach. This muscle normally stays closed, so the stomach contents don't flow back into the esophagus. In children who have reflux and GERD, this muscle becomes weak or relaxes when it shouldn't, and the stomach contents flow back into the esophagus.

Sometimes doctors order more than one test to get a diagnosis. Commonly-used tests include: Upper GI series , which looks at the shape of your child's upper GI (gastrointestinal) tract. You child will drink a contrast liquid called barium. For young children, the barium is mixed in with a bottle or other food. The health care professional will take several x-rays of your child to track the barium as it goes through the esophagus and stomach. Esophageal pH and impedance monitoring , which measures the amount of acid or liquid in your child's esophagus. A doctor or nurse places a thin flexible tube through your child's nose into the stomach. The end of the tube in the esophagus measures when and how much acid comes back up into the esophagus. The other end of the tube attaches to a monitor that records the measurements. Your child will wear the tube for 24 hours. He or she may need to stay in the hospital during the test. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy and biopsy , which uses an endoscope, a long, flexible tube with a light and camera at the end of it. The doctor runs the endoscope down your child's esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine.

But if your chronic respiratory failure is severe, you might need treatment in a long-term care center. One of the main goals of treatment is to get oxygen to your lungs and other organs and remove carbon dioxide from your body. Another goal is to treat the cause of the condition. Treatments may include: Oxygen therapy , through a nasal cannula (two small plastic tubes that go in your nostrils) or through a mask that fits over your nose and mouth Tracheostomy, a surgically-made hole that goes through the front of your neck and into your windpipe. A breathing tube, also called a tracheostomy, or trach tube, is placed in the hole to help you breathe. Ventilator, a breathing machine that blows air into your lungs. It also carries carbon dioxide out of your lungs. Other breathing treatments, such as noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), which uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open while you sleep. Another treatment is a special bed that rocks back and forth, to help you breathe in and out. Fluids, often through an intravenous (IV), to improve blood flow throughout your body. They also provide nutrition. Medicines for discomfort Treatments for the cause of the respiratory failure. These treatments may include medicines and procedures. If you have respiratory failure, see your health care provider for ongoing medical care. Your provider may suggest pulmonary rehabilitation .

If you are pregnant, there is a vaccine that is available to give between 32 and 36 weeks of pregnancy. It helps protect their newborn babies from RSV illness for the first 6 months of life. There are two medicines to help prevent severe RSV illness in babies and young children. These medicines may help prevent severe RSV illness, but they can't cure or treat children who already have RSV. And they cannot prevent an RSV infection. Both medicines are given by injections (shots). One medicine is given to infants who are younger than 8 months during their first RSV season. This includes infants who are born during RSV season. This medicine may also be given to some children between the ages of 8 and 19 months who are at high risk for severe RSV illness. For example, they might be at high risk because they: Were born prematurely Have congenital heart disease Have chronic lung disease Have a weakened immune system The other medicine is given monthly during RSV season. It is for children under 24 months of age who are at high risk for severe RSV illness. There are also some steps you can take to lower your risk of getting or spreading an RSV infection, including: Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds Avoiding touching your face, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands Avoiding close contact, such as kissing, shaking hands, and sharing cups and eating utensils, with others if you are sick or they are sick Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that you frequently touch Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue.

                "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a form of arthritis that causes pain, swelling, and stiffness in your joints. RA is an autoimmune disease . Although it is most common in the wrist and fingers, this disease can cause your immune system to attack any joint tissue. The inflammation (swelling) that comes with RA can also affect other body parts. Inflammation could cause medical issues in your eyes, skin, heart, nerves, blood, or lungs. RA differs from osteoarthritis , a common arthritis that often comes with age. RA affects the lining of your joints and damages the tissue that covers the ends of the bones in a joint. Eventually, this might cause your joints to not work as well. There is no cure for RA, but early treatment can help you manage symptoms, reduce joint damage, and lead a productive life."

Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. With SCD, the hemoglobin forms into stiff rods within the red blood cells. This changes the shape of the red blood cells. The cells are supposed to be disc-shaped, but instead they are crescent, or sickle, shaped. The sickle-shaped cells are not flexible and cannot change shape easily. Many of them burst apart as they move through your blood vessels. The sickle cells usually only last 10 to 20 days, instead of the normal 90 to 120 days. Your body may have trouble making enough new cells to replace the ones that you lost. Because of this, you may not have enough red blood cells. This is a condition called anemia , and it can make you feel tired. The sickle-shaped cells can also stick to vessel walls, causing a blockage that slows or stops the flow of blood. When this happens, oxygen can't reach nearby tissues. The lack of oxygen can cause attacks of sudden, severe pain, called pain crises. These attacks can occur without warning. If you get one, you might need to go to the hospital for treatment."

                "A blood test can show if you have SCD or sickle cell trait. Genetic tests can tell if you have one or two copies of the sickle cell gene. Genetic tests can help confirm an SCD diagnosis if the results from blood tests are not clear. All states now test newborns for SCD (as well as many other treatable conditions) as part of their screening programs . These programs help find the conditions early, so treatment can be started right away. Health care providers can also diagnose SCD before a baby is born. That test uses a sample of amniotic fluid (the liquid in the sac surrounding the baby) or tissue taken from the placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to the baby). People who are thinking about having children can have the test to find out how likely it is that their children will have SCD."

                "What are the treatments for sickle cell disease (SCD)?",
                "There are many ways to manage sickle cell disease. Your medical team will probably include a hematologist, a doctor who specializes in blood diseases. You will work with your medical team to set up a treatment plan. Possible treatment options may include: Treatments that can help relieve symptoms and lessen complications, including: Hydroxyurea, a medicine to reduce sickling of red blood cells. This can help prevent serious symptoms of sickle cell disease. This medicine can be used in adults and in children as young as 9 months old.  But this medicine is not safe during pregnancy. Voxelotor, another medicine to prevent the sickling of red blood cells. It can be used in adults and children ages 4 years and older. Pain relievers for acute or chronic pain. Antibiotics to try to prevent infections in younger children. Blood transfusions for severe anemia. If you have had some serious complications, such as a stroke , you may have transfusions to prevent more complications. Other treatments for specific complications, such as medicines to lower blood pressure and vitamins to treat a vitamin deficiency. Bone marrow or stem cell transplantation, which can cure SCD. Because these transplants are risky and can have serious side effects, they are usually only used in children with severe SCD. For the transplant to work, the bone marrow must be a close match. Usually, the best donor is a brother or sister. Gene therapies to treat SCD in people who are 12 years and older and have had repeated sickle cell crises. These new therapies involve taking some of your blood stem cells and either adding new DNA to them or changing their existing DNA. Then these cells are given back to you, and they can make a type of hemoglobin that is healthy. This can reduce the complications of SCD, including the SCD crises. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) seems to help some people deal with pain caused by SCD. These types of CAM may lower your pain, especially if it is not well managed with medicines:: Cognitive behavioral therapy (a type of counseling) Acupuncture Exercise or movement programs, such as yoga Massage Meditation and mindfulness practices Virtual reality, a computer-generated 3D environment you can see with special goggles It's also important to take steps to keep yourself as healthy as possible: Get regular medical care Get your routine vaccinations Live a healthy lifestyle Avoid situations that may set off a pain crisis NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"

When you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks healthy tissues and organs by mistake. In Sjogren's syndrome, your immune system attacks the glands that make moisture in the eyes, mouth, and other parts of the body. This causes a dry mouth and dry eyes . You may have dryness in other places that need moisture, such as your nose, throat, and skin. Sjogren's can also affect other parts of the body, including your joints, lungs, kidneys, blood vessels, digestive organs, and nerves."

But they think that it is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Studies have linked Sjogren's syndrome to gene changes in several genes.

It is the most severe type. It is also the most common. Babies with this type usually show signs of the disease before 6 months of age. In more severe cases, the signs show up even before or just after birth (Types 0 or 1A). The babies may have trouble swallowing and breathing and may not move around a lot. They have chronic shortening of muscles or tendons (called contractures). They usually cannot sit up without help. Without treatment, many children with this type will die before 2 years of age. Type ll is a moderate to severe type of SMA. It usually first noticed between 6 and 18 months of age. Most children with this type can sit without support but cannot stand or walk without help. They may also have trouble breathing. They can usually live into adolescence or young adulthood. Type lll is also called Kugelberg-Welander disease. It is the mildest type that affects children. The signs of the disease usually show up after age 18 months. Children with this type can walk by themselves but may have trouble running, getting up from a chair, or climbing stairs. They may also have scoliosis (curvature of the spine), contractures, and respiratory infections. With treatment, most children with this type will have a normal lifespan. Type IV is rare and often mild. It usually causes symptoms after 21 years of age. The symptoms include mild to moderate leg muscle weakness, tremors , and mild breathing problems.

But when part of the SMN1 gene is missing or abnormal, there isn't enough protein for the motor neurons. This causes the motor neurons to die off. Most people have two copies of the SM1 gene - one from each parent. SMA normally only happens when both copies have the gene change. If only one copy has the change, there usually aren't any symptoms. But that gene could be passed down from parent to child.

Staph bacteria can cause many different types of infections, including: Skin infections , which are the most common types of staph infections. Bacteremia, an infection of the bloodstream. This can lead to sepsis , a very serious immune response to infection. Bone infections . Endocarditis , an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. Food poisoning . Pneumonia . Toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a life-threatening condition caused by toxins from certain types of bacteria."

Bone infections can cause pain, swelling, warmth, and redness in the infected area. You may also have chills and a fever . Endocarditis causes some flu-like symptoms: fever , chills, and fatigue. It also causes symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, and fluid buildup in your arms or legs. Food poisoning typically causes nausea and vomiting , diarrhea , and fever. If you lose too many fluids, you may also become dehydrated . Pneumonia symptoms include a high fever, chills, and cough that doesn't get better.

Talk to your provider if you have any concerns about your statin or if you would like to stop or change to a different treatment. Ask your provider which other medicines, supplements , or foods you should avoid. Some of these can interact with statins and cause serious side effects or make statins less effective. For example, grapefruit (fresh or as juice) affects how your liver breaks down some statins. Tell your provider about any symptoms or side effects you are having. Sometimes, people report muscle problems while taking statins. If you start having muscle pain, your provider may order a blood test to look look for muscle damage.

Hormones are chemicals that travel in your bloodstream and control how different parts of your body work. The hormones that are released when you are stressed make you alert and ready to act. They can raise your blood pressure, heart rate, and blood glucose (blood sugar) levels. This response is sometimes called a \"fight or flight\" response. Everyone gets stressed from time to time. There are different types of stress. It can be short-term or long-term. It can be caused by something that happens once or something that keeps happening. Not all stress is bad. In fact, it can help you survive in a dangerous situation. For example, one kind of stress is the jolt you may feel when a car pulls out in front of you while you are driving. This jolt of hormones helps you quickly hit the brakes to avoid an accident. A little short-term stress can sometimes be helpful. For example, the stress of having a deadline for school or your job may push you to get your work done on time. Once you finish it, that stress goes away.

You can only get this medicine within 4 hours of when your symptoms started. The sooner you can get it, the better your chance of recovery. If you cannot get that medicine, you may get medicine that helps stop platelets from clumping together to form blood clots. Or you may get a blood thinner to keep existing clots from getting bigger. If you have carotid artery disease, you may also need a procedure to open your blocked carotid artery Acute treatments for hemorrhagic stroke focus on stopping the bleeding. The first step is to find the cause of bleeding in the brain. The next step is to control it: If high blood pressure is the cause of bleeding, you may be given blood pressure medicines . If an aneurysm if the cause, you may need aneurysm clipping or coil embolization. These are surgeries to prevent further leaking of blood from the aneurysm. It also can help prevent the aneurysm from bursting again. If an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is the cause of a stroke, you may need an AVM repair. An AVM is a tangle of faulty arteries and veins that can rupture within the brain. An AVM repair may be done through Surgery Injecting a substance into the blood vessels of the AVM to block blood flow Radiation to shrink the blood vessels of the AVM Stroke rehabilitation can help you relearn skills you lost because of the damage.

You need to work with the speech-language pathologist to figure out the best plan for you or your child. The plan should take into account how long the stuttering has been going on and whether there are any other speech or language problems. For a child, the plan should also take into account your child's age and whether he or she is likely to outgrow the stuttering. Younger children may not need therapy right away. Their parents and teachers can learn strategies to help the child practice speaking. That can help some children. As a parent, it's important to be calm and relaxed when your child is speaking. If your child feels pressured, it can make it harder for them to talk. The speech-language pathologist will probably want to evaluate your child regularly, to see whether treatment is needed. Speech therapy can help children and adults minimize stuttering. Some techniques include: Speaking more slowly Controlling breathing Gradually working up from single-syllable responses to longer words and more complex sentences For adults, self-help groups can help you find resources and support as you face the challenges of stuttering. There are electronic devices to help with fluency, but more research is needed to see whether they really help over the long term. Some people have tried medicines that usually treat other health problems such as epilepsy, anxiety, or depression.

An SCA can happen when the heart's electrical system is not working right and causes irregular heartbeats. Irregular heartbeats are called arrhythmias . There are different types. They may cause the heart to beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm. Some can cause the heart to stop pumping blood to the body; this is the type that causes SCA. Certain diseases and conditions can cause the electrical problems that lead to SCA. They include: Ventricular fibrillation , a type of arrhythmia where the ventricles (the heart's lower chambers) don't beat normally. Instead, they beat very fast and very irregularly. They can't pump blood to the body. This causes most SCAs. Coronary artery disease (CAD) , also called ischemic heart disease. CAD happens when the arteries of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart. It is often caused by the buildup of plaque , a waxy substance, inside the lining of larger coronary arteries. The plaque blocks some or all of the blood flow to the heart. Some types of physical stress can cause your heart's electrical system to fail, such as Intense physical activity in which your body releases the hormone adrenaline. This hormone can trigger SCA in people who have heart problems. Very low blood levels of potassium or magnesium. These minerals play an important role in your heart's electrical system. Major blood loss Severe lack of oxygen Certain inherited disorders which can cause arrhythmias or problems with the structure of your heart Structural changes in the heart , such as an enlarged heart due to high blood pressure or advanced heart disease.

If you are at high risk for SCA, your provider may refer you to a cardiologist, a doctor who specializes in heart diseases.

The electric shock can restore a normal rhythm to a heart that's stopped beating. To work well, it needs to be done within minutes of the SCA. Most police officers, emergency medical technicians, and other first responders are trained and equipped to use a defibrillator. Call 9-1-1 right away if someone has signs or symptoms of SCA.

AEDs are special defibrillators that untrained people can use if they think that someone has had SCA. AEDS are programmed to give an electric shock if they detect a dangerous arrhythmia. This prevents giving a shock to someone who may have fainted but isn't having SCA. If you see someone who you think has had SCA, you should give cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) until defibrillation can be done. People who are at risk for SCA may want to consider having an AED at home. Ask your cardiologist to help you decide whether having an AED in your home might help you."

They may give you medicines to try to reduce the risk of another SCA. They will also try to find out what caused your SCA. If you're diagnosed with coronary artery disease, you may have an angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery . These procedures help restore blood flow through narrowed or blocked coronary arteries. Often, people who have had SCA get a device called an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) .

They are a form of radiation. UV rays do help your body make vitamin D , but too much exposure damages your skin. Most people can get the vitamin D that they need with only about 5 to 15 minutes of sun exposure two to three times a week. There are three types of UV rays. Two of them, UVA and UVB, can reach the earth's surface and affect your skin. Using a tanning bed also exposes you to UVA and UVB. UVB rays can cause sunburn. UVA rays can travel more deeply into the skin than UVB rays. When your skin is exposed to UVA, it tries to protect itself from further damage. It does this by making more melanin, which is the skin pigment that makes your skin darker. That's what gives you a tan. This means that your tan is a sign of skin damage."

It should also be a broad-spectrum sunscreen, which means that it gives you both UVA and UVB protection. If you have very light skin, use SPF 30 or higher. Apply sunscreen 20-30 minutes before going outside and reapply it at least every 2 hours. Wear sunglasses that block both UVA and UVB rays. Wrap-around sunglasses work best because they block UV rays from sneaking in from the side. Wear a hat . You can get the best protection with a wide-brimmed hat that is made out of a tightly woven fabric, such as canvas. Wear protective clothing such as long-sleeved shirts and long pants and skirts. Clothes made from tightly woven fabric offer the best protection. It is also important to check your skin once a month.

Some people think that getting a \"base tan\" in a tanning salon can protect you when you go in the sun. But a \"base tan\" causes damage to your skin and will not prevent you from getting sunburn when you go outside. Indoor tanning is particularly dangerous for younger people.

It involves going to see a therapist, such as a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a social worker, or counselor. You can talk out your emotions to someone who understands and supports you. You can also learn how to stop thinking negatively and start to look at the positives in life. This will help you build confidence and feel better about yourself. There are many different types of talk therapy. Certain types have been shown to help teens deal with depression, including: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which helps you to identify and change negative and unhelpful thoughts. It also helps you build coping skills and change behavioral patterns. Interpersonal therapy (IPT), which focuses on improving your relationships. It helps you understand and work through troubled relationships that may contribute to your depression. IPT may help you change behaviors that are causing problems.  You also explore major issues that may add to your depression, such as grief or life changes. Medicines In some cases, your doctor will suggest medicines along with talk therapy. There are a few antidepressants that have been widely studied and proven to help teens. If you are taking medicine for depression, it is important to see your doctor regularly. It is also important to know that it will take some time for you to get relief from antidepressants: It can take 3 to 4 weeks until an antidepressant takes effect You may have to try more than one antidepressant to find one that works for you It can also take some time to find the right dose of an antidepressant In some cases, teenagers may have an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants. This risk is higher in the first few weeks after starting the medicine and when the dose is changed. Make sure to tell your parents or guardian if you start feeling worse or have thoughts of hurting yourself. You should not stop taking the antidepressants on your own. You need to work with your doctor to slowly and safely decrease the dose before you stop. Programs for severe depression Some teens who have severe depression or are at risk of hurting themselves may need more intensive treatment. They may go into a psychiatric hospital or do a day program. Both offer counseling, group discussions, and activities with mental health professionals and other patients. Day programs may be full-day or half-day, and they often last for several weeks."

Medicines such as: Anti-anxiety medicines Antidepressants Anti-seizure medicines Prescription pain relievers An intraoral appliance , which is a device that fits over your teeth. Types of intraoral appliances include oral splints and mouth guards. If you are going to use one, it's important to: Know that there is not a lot of evidence that they improve TMD pain. Make sure that the appliance you have is not designed to permanently change your bite. Let your provider or dentist know if it makes your pain worse. Complementary treatments , which are treatments that are used along with mainstream medical care. There is limited evidence showing that they help with TMD symptoms. But some providers and dentists may recommend acupuncture and transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS). TENS involves using a device to send a gentle electric current to your nerves or muscles. It may help treat pain by interrupting or blocking the pain signals. If you are still having severe symptoms from a TMD, your provider or dentist may suggest surgery, including implant surgery, or another procedure. It's important to be careful, because sometimes surgery or another procedure may not work or may even make your symptoms worse. Before any surgery or other procedure, it is very important to get opinions from more than one provider and to completely understand the risks.

These bacteria combine with food to form a soft, sticky film called plaque. The bacteria in plaque use the sugar and starch in what you eat and drink to make acids. The acids begin to eat away at the minerals on your enamel. Over time, the plaque can harden into tartar. Besides damaging your teeth, plaque and tartar can also irritate your gums and cause gum disease . You get fluoride from toothpaste, water, and other sources. This fluoride, along with your salvia, helps the enamel repair itself by replacing the minerals. Your teeth go through this natural process of losing minerals and regaining minerals all day long. But if you don't take care of your teeth and/or you eat and drink lots of sugary or starchy things, your enamel will keep losing minerals. This leads to tooth decay. A white spot may appear where minerals have been lost. This is an early sign of tooth decay. You may be able to stop or reverse the decay at this point. Your enamel can still repair itself, if you take better care of your teeth and limit sugary/starchy foods and drinks. But if the tooth decay process continues, more minerals are lost. Over time, the enamel is weakened and destroyed, forming a cavity. A cavity is a hole in your tooth. It is permanent damage that a dentist has to repair with a filling."

If you have early tooth decay, a fluoride treatment can help the enamel to repair itself. Fillings. If you have a typical cavity, your dentist will remove the decayed tooth tissue and then restore the tooth by filling it with a filling material. Root canal. If the damage to the tooth and/or an infection spreads to the pulp (inside of the tooth), you might need a root canal. Your dentist will remove the decayed pulp and clean inside the tooth and root. The next step is to fill the tooth with a temporary filling. Then you will need to come back to get a permanent filling or a crown (a cover on the tooth). Extraction (pulling the tooth). In the most severe cases, when the damage to the pulp cannot be fixed, your dentist may pull the tooth. Your dentist will suggest that you get a bridge or implant to replace the missing tooth. Otherwise, the teeth next to the gap may move over and change your bite."

Most bottled water does not contain fluoride. Using fluoride mouth rinse Practice good oral health by brushing your teeth twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste and regularly flossing your teeth Make smart food choices by limiting foods and drinks that are high in sugars and starches. Eat nutritious, balanced meals and limit snacking. Do not use tobacco products, including smokeless tobacco . If you currently use tobacco, consider quitting . See a dentist for regular check-ups and professional cleanings Make sure that your children get sealants on their teeth. Dental sealants are thin plastic coatings that protect the chewing surfaces of the back teeth. Children should get sealants on their back teeth as soon as they come in, before decay can attack the teeth. NIH: National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research"

                "Urinary incontinence (UI) is the loss of bladder control, or being unable to control urination. It is a common condition. It can range from being a minor problem to something that greatly affects your daily life.  In any case, it can get better with proper treatment."

                "What are the types of urinary incontinence (UI)?",
                "There are several different types of UI. Each type has different symptoms and causes: Stress incontinence happens when stress or pressure on your bladder causes you to leak urine.  This could be due to coughing, sneezing, laughing, lifting something heavy, or physical activity. Causes include weak pelvic floor muscles and the bladder being out of its normal position. Urge, or urgency, incontinence happens when you have a strong urge (need) to urinate, and some urine leaks out before you can make it to the toilet. It is often related to an overactive bladder . Urge incontinence is most common in older people. It can sometimes be a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI) . It can also happen in some neurological conditions , such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injuries . Overflow incontinence happens when your bladder doesn't empty all the way. This causes too much urine to stay in your bladder. Your bladder gets too full, and you leak urine. This form of UI is most common in men. Some of the causes include tumors, kidney stones , diabetes , and certain medicines. Functional incontinence happens when a physical or mental disability , trouble speaking , or some other problem keeps you from getting to the toilet in time. For example, someone with arthritis may have trouble unbuttoning his or her pants, or a person with Alzheimer's disease may not realize they need to plan to use the toilet. Mixed incontinence means that you have more than one type of incontinence. It's usually a combination of stress and urge incontinence. Transient incontinence is urine leakage that is caused by a temporary (transient) situation such as an infection or new medicine. Once the cause is removed, the incontinence goes away. Bedwetting refers to urine leakage during sleep. This is most common in children, but adults can also have it. Bedwetting is normal for many children. It is more common in boys. Bedwetting is often not considered a health problem, especially when it runs in the family. But if it still happens often at age 5 and older, it may be because of a bladder control problem. This problem could be caused by slow physical development, an illness, making too much urine at night, or another problem. Sometimes there is more than one cause. In adults, the causes include some medicines, caffeine , and alcohol . It can also be caused by certain health problems, such as diabetes insipidus , a urinary tract infection (UTI), kidney stones, enlarged prostate (BPH), and sleep apnea ."

As you age, your urinary tract muscles weaken, making it harder to hold in urine. Are a man with prostate problems Have certain health problems, such as diabetes, obesity , or long-lasting constipation Are a smoker Have a birth defect that affects the structure of your urinary tract In children, bedwetting is more common in younger children, boys, and those whose parents wet the bed when they were children."

                "Treatment depends on the type and cause of your UI. You may need a combination of treatments. Your provider may first suggest self-care treatments, including: Lifestyle changes to reduce leaks: Drinking the right amount of liquid at the right time Being physically active Staying at a healthy weigh Avoiding constipation Not smoking Bladder training. This involves urinating according to a schedule. Your provider makes a schedule from you, based on information from your bladder diary. After you adjust to the schedule, you gradually wait a little longer between trips to the bathroom. This can help stretch your bladder so it can hold more urine. Doing exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles . Strong pelvic floor muscles hold in urine better than weak muscles. The strengthening exercises are called Kegel exercises. They involve tightening and relaxing the muscles that control urine flow. If these treatments do not work, your provider may suggest other options such as: Medicines , which can be used to Relax the bladder muscles, to help prevent bladder spasms Block nerve signals that cause urinary frequency and urgency In men, shrink the prostate and improve urine flow Medical devices , including A catheter, which is a tube to carry urine out of the body. You might use one a few times a day or all the time. For women, a ring or a tampon-like device inserted into the vagina. The devices pushes up against your urethra to help decrease leaks. Bulking agents , which are injected into the bladder neck and urethra tissues to thicken them. This helps close your bladder opening so you have less leaking. Electrical nerve stimulation , which involves changing your bladder's reflexes using pulses of electricity Surgery to support the bladder in its normal position. This may be done with a sling that is attached to the pubic bone. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"

The germs could be viruses or bacteria . Some types of vaccines contain germs that cause disease. But the germs have been killed or weakened enough that they won't make you sick. Some vaccines only contain a part of a germ. Other types of vaccines include instructions for your cells to make a protein of the germ. These different vaccine types all spark an immune response, which helps your body fight off the germs. Your immune system will also remember the germ and attack it if that germ ever invades again. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity. These diseases can be very serious.

                "Every vaccine that is approved in the United States goes through extensive safety testing. It starts with testing and evaluation of the vaccine before it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This process can often take several years.: First, the vaccine is tested in labs. Based on those tests, the FDA decides whether to test the vaccine with people. Testing with people is done through clinical trials . In these trials, the vaccines are tested on volunteers. Clinical trials usually start with 20 to 100 volunteers, but eventually include thousands of volunteers. The clinical trials have three phases. The trials are looking for the answer to important questions such as Is the vaccine safe? What dose (amount) works best? How does the immune system react to it? How effective is it? During the process, the FDA works closely with the company who makes the vaccine to evaluate the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. If the vaccine is found to be safe and effective, it will be approved and licensed by the FDA. After a vaccine is licensed, experts may consider adding it to the recommended vaccine, or immunization, schedule. This schedule is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It lists which vaccines are recommended for different groups of people. They list which age groups should get which vaccines, how many doses they need, and when they should get them. Testing and monitoring continue after the vaccine is approved: The company making the vaccines tests every batch of vaccines for quality and safety. The FDA reviews the results of these tests. It also inspects the factories where the vaccine is made. These checks help make sure the vaccines meet standards for quality and safety. The FDA, CDC, and other federal agencies continue to monitor its safety, to watch for possible side effects. They have systems to track any safety issues with the vaccines. These high safety standards and testing help to make sure that vaccines in the United States are safe. Vaccines help protect against serious, even deadly, diseases. They not only protect you, but also help to keep these diseases from spreading to others."

Viral vector vaccines use genetic material, which gives your cells instructions for making a protein of the germ. These vaccines also contain a different, harmless virus that helps get the genetic material into your cells. These vaccines may work in different ways, but they all spark an immune response.

But when enough people are vaccinated against a certain disease, it's harder for that disease to spread to others. This type of protection means that the entire community is less likely to get the disease. Community immunity is especially important for people who can't get certain vaccines. For example, they may not be able to get a vaccine because they have weakened immune systems. Others may be allergic to certain vaccine ingredients.

                "The treatment depends on which type of vaginitis you have. BV is treatable with antibiotics . You may get pills to swallow, or cream or gel that you put in your vagina. During treatment, you should use a condom during sex or not have sex at all. Yeast infections are usually treated with a cream or with medicine that you put inside your vagina. You can buy over-the-counter treatments for yeast infections, but you need to be sure that you do have a yeast infection and not another type of vaginitis. See your health care provider if this is the first time you have had symptoms. Even if you have had yeast infections before, it is a good idea to call your health care provider before using an over-the-counter treatment. The treatment for trichomoniasis is usually a single-dose antibiotic. Both you and your partner(s) should be treated, to prevent spreading the infection to others and to keep from getting it again. If your vaginitis is due to an allergy or sensitivity to a product, you need to figure out which product is causing the problem. It could be a product that you started using recently. Once you figure it out, you should stop using the product. If the cause of your vaginitis is a hormonal change, your health care provider may give you estrogen cream to help with your symptoms."

It includes your: Arteries, which carry oxygen-rich blood from your heart to your tissues and organs Veins, which carry the blood and waste products back to your heart Capillaries, which are tiny blood vessels that connect your small arteries to your small veins. The walls of the capillaries are thin and leaky, to allow for an exchange of materials between your tissues and blood. Vascular diseases are conditions which affect your vascular system. They are common and can be serious. Some types include: Aneurysm - a bulge or \"ballooning\" in the wall of an artery Atherosclerosis - a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Blood clots , including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism Coronary artery disease and carotid artery disease , diseases that involve the narrowing or blockage of an artery. The cause is usually a buildup of plaque. Raynaud phenomenon - a disorder that causes the blood vessels to narrow when you are cold or feeling stressed Stroke - a serious condition that happens when blood flow to your brain stops. Varicose veins - swollen, twisted veins that you can see just under the skin Vasculitis - inflammation of the blood vessels"

The plaque that builds up is a sticky substance made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Over time, the plaque hardens and narrows your arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your body. It can lead to coronary artery disease and other heart diseases ."

The lab can use your triglyceride level to estimate what your VLDL level is. Your VLDL is about one-fifth of your triglyceride level. However, estimating your VLDL this way does not work if your triglyceride level is very high."

You may be able to lower your triglycerides with a combination of losing weight, changing your diet, and getting exercise. It is important to switch to healthy fats and cut back on sugar and alcohol. Some people may also need to take medicines."

Many people are getting less physical activity because they are spending more time using smartphones and other devices. Families. Overweight and obesity tend to run in families. Overweight and obesity tend to run in families. This suggests that genes may play a role in weight gain. Families may also share eating and lifestyle habits. For example, some families may often have foods and drinks that are high in calories, sugar, and fat. And some families may tend to be less active and spend more time doing things like sitting and watching TV or using computers. Not enough sleep. People who don't get enough sleep may eat more calories and snack more. Emotions. Some people eat when they feel bored, sad, or stressed, even if they are not hungry. Medicines and health conditions.

Some ways to do this are: Eating more nutrient-rich foods, such as foods with lots of vitamins , minerals , and fiber . Eating and drinking less of the foods and beverages that have lots of calories, salt , sugar, and fat. Limiting alcohol . Finding healthier ways to cook, such as using healthier oils to cook with and baking or grilling instead of frying foods. Getting more physical activity . The general recommendation is for adults to get 150 minutes of physical activity each week, including: Aerobic activity, which is also called cardio. It uses your large muscle groups (chest, legs, and back) to speed up your heart rate and breathing. Muscle-strengthening activity, which is also called strength training. It works your muscles by making you push or pull against something. You may decide to do these lifestyle changes on your own, or you may decide to try a weight-loss diet or program. Before you start, it's important to check with your health care provider first. Your provider can tell you what a healthy weight is for you, help you set goals, and give you tips on how to lose weight. If making lifestyle changes or doing a weight-loss program are not enough to help you lose weight, your provider may prescribe medicines. The prescription medicines to treat overweight and obesity work in different ways. Some may help you feel less hungry or full sooner. Others may make it harder for your body to absorb fat from the foods you eat. Another treatment is weight loss surgery . Your provider may recommend the surgery if you have severe obesity or serious obesity-related health problems and you have not been able to lose enough weight.
