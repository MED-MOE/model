The aim of this prospective study was to demonstrate dysfunction of the anal sphincter and/or the musculus (m.) puborectalis in patients with dyschesia using anorectal endosonography. Twenty consecutive patients with a medical history of dyschesia and a control group of 20 healthy subjects underwent linear anorectal endosonography (Toshiba models IUV 5060 and PVL-625 RT). In both groups, the dimensions of the anal sphincter and the m. puborectalis were measured at rest, and during voluntary squeezing and straining. Statistical analysis was performed within and between the two groups. The anal sphincter became paradoxically shorter and/or thicker during straining (versus the resting state) in 85% of patients but in only 35% of control subjects. Changes in sphincter length were statistically significantly different (p<0.01, chi(2) test) in patients compared with control subjects. The m. puborectalis became paradoxically shorter and/or thicker during straining in 80% of patients but in only 30% of controls. Both the changes in length and thickness of the m. puborectalis were significantly different (p<0.01, chi(2) test) in patients versus control subjects.

      "QUESTION: Sublingual varices have earlier been related to ageing, smoking and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate whether sublingual varices are related to presence of hypertension. In an observational clinical study among 431 dental patients tongue status and blood pressure were documented. Digital photographs of the lateral borders of the tongue for grading of sublingual varices were taken, and blood pressure was measured. Those patients without previous diagnosis of hypertension and with a noted blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or ≥ 90 mmHg at the dental clinic performed complementary home blood pressure during one week. Those with an average home blood pressure ≥ 135 mmHg and/or ≥ 85 mmHg were referred to the primary health care centre, where three office blood pressure measurements were taken with one week intervals. Two independent blinded observers studied the photographs of the tongues. Each photograph was graded as none/few (grade 0) or medium/severe (grade 1) presence of sublingual varices. Pearson's Chi-square test, Student's t-test, and multiple regression analysis were applied. Power calculation stipulated a study population of 323 patients. An association between sublingual varices and hypertension was found (OR = 2.25, p<0.002). Mean systolic blood pressure was 123 and 132 mmHg in patients with grade 0 and grade 1 sublingual varices, respectively (p<0.0001, CI 95 %). Mean diastolic blood pressure was 80 and 83 mmHg in patients with grade 0 and grade 1 sublingual varices, respectively (p<0.005, CI 95 %).

A 52-year-old woman underwent a craniotomy for a ruptured internal carotid aneurysm. A computed tomography scan showed that SAH existed predominantly in the posterior fossa and subdural hematoma beneath the cerebellar tentorium. Intrathecal administration of urokinase, IV administration of fasudil hydrochloride, and continuous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evacuation via cisternal drainage were performed as prophylactic treatments for vasospasm. On the sixth postoperative day, the patient complained of severe lower back and buttock pain. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a subdural hematoma in the lumbosacral region. Although the mass effect was extensive, the patient showed no neurologic symptoms other than the sciatica. She was treated conservatively. The hematoma dissolved gradually and had diminished completely 15 weeks later. Her pain gradually subsided, and she was discharged 7 weeks later without any neurologic deficit.

On the sixth postoperative day, the patient complained of severe lower back and buttock pain. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a subdural hematoma in the lumbosacral region. Although the mass effect was extensive, the patient showed no neurologic symptoms other than the sciatica. She was treated conservatively. The hematoma dissolved gradually and had diminished completely 15 weeks later. Her pain gradually subsided, and she was discharged 7 weeks later without any neurologic deficit.

      "QUESTION: For women, the correlation between circulating androgens and sexual desire is inconclusive. Substitution with androgens at physiological levels improves sexual function in women who experience decreased sexual desire and androgen deficiency from surgical menopause, pituitary disease, and age-related decline in androgen production in the ovaries. Measuring bioactive testosterone is difficult and new methods have been proposed, including measuring the primary androgen metabolite androsterone glucuronide (ADT-G).AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correlation between serum levels of androgens and sexual desire in women and whether the level of ADT-G is better correlated than the level of circulating androgens with sexual desire. This was a cross-sectional study including 560 healthy women aged 19-65 years divided into three age groups. Correlations were considered to be statistically significant at P<0.05. Sexual desire was determined as the total score of the sexual desire domain of the Female Sexual Function Index. Total testosterone (TT), calculated free testosterone (FT), androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and ADT-G were analyzed using mass spectrometry. Sexual desire correlated overall with FT and androstenedione in the total cohort of women. In a subgroup of women aged 25-44 years with no use of systemic hormonal contraception, sexual desire correlated with TT, FT, androstenedione, and DHEAS. In women aged 45-65 years, androstenedione correlated with sexual desire. No correlations between ADT-G and sexual desire were identified. Is there a correlation between androgens and sexual desire in women?\n",

      "QUESTION: Uncontrolled hemorrhage is the leading cause of fatality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of zeolite mineral (QuikClot - Advanced Clotting Sponge [QC-ACS]) on blood loss and physiological variables in a swine extremity arterial injury model. Sixteen swine were used. Oblique groin incision was created and a 5 mm incision was made. The animals were allocated to: control group (n: 6): Pressure dressing was applied with manual pressure over gauze sponge; or QC group (n: 10): QC was directly applied over lacerated femoral artery. Mean arterial pressure, blood loss and physiological parameters were measured during the study period. Application of QC led to a slower drop in blood pressure. The control group had a significantly higher increase in lactate within 60 minutes. The mean prothrombin time in the control group was significantly increased at 60 minutes. The application of QC led to decreased total blood loss. The QC group had significantly higher hematocrit levels. QC application generated a significant heat production. There were mild edematous and vacuolar changes in nerve samples. Is the zeolite hemostatic agent beneficial in reducing blood loss during arterial injury?\n",

      "QUESTION: The most common primary brain tumors in children and adults are of astrocytic origin. Classic histologic grading schemes for astrocytomas have included evaluating the presence or absence of nuclear abnormalities, mitoses, vascular endothelial proliferation, and tumor necrosis. We evaluated the vascular pattern of 17 astrocytoma surgical specimens (seven from children and 10 from adults), and four normal brains obtained at autopsy, utilizing antibody to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) utilizing confocal microscopy. A modified WHO classification was used. All tumor cases showed cells positive for GFAP. Control tissues showed a few, widely separated vessels. Pilocytic astrocytomas (four cases) showed lacy clusters of small-to-medium sized vessels, with intact vessel wall integrity. Diffuse, low grade astrocytoma (three cases) showed a staining pattern similar to control tissue; intermediate grade (one case), anaplastic astrocytoma (three cases) and gliobastoma multiforme (six cases) showed an increased vessel density with multiple small vessels (glomeruloid clusters), some with prominent intimal hyperplasia, loss of vessel wall integrity, and with numerous vWF-positive single cells/microvessels within the tumor substance. Are endothelial cell patterns of astrocytomas indicative of grade?\n",

      "QUESTION: 79 adjacent proximal surfaces without restorations in permanent teeth were examined. Patients suspected to have carious lesions after a visual clinical and a bitewing examination participated in a CBCT examination (Kodak 9000 3D, 5 × 3.7 cm field of view, voxel size 0.07 mm). Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained according to the Helsinki Declaration. Radiographic assessment recording lesions with or without cavitation was performed by two observers in bitewings and CBCT sections. Orthodontic separators were placed interdentally between two lesion-suspected surfaces. The separator was removed after 3 days and the surfaces recorded as cavitated (yes/no), i.e. validated clinically. Differences between the two radiographic modalities (sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy) were estimated by analyzing the binary data in a generalized linear model. For both observers, sensitivity was significantly higher for CBCT than for bitewings (average difference 33%, p<0.001) while specificity was not significantly different between the methods (p = 0.19). The overall accuracy was also significantly higher for CBCT (p<0.001). Should cavitation in proximal surfaces be reported in cone beam computed tomography examination?\n",

      "QUESTION: As part of the staging procedure in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, we assessed the role of ultrasound examination, in particular its role in assessing the extent and the invasion into the corpora. From 1988 until 1992, all patients referred for primary treatment underwent ultrasound assessment with a 7.5 MHz linear array small parts transducer as part of the clinical workup. All ultrasound images were reviewed by one radiologist, without knowledge of the clinical outcome and were compared with the results obtained at histopathologic examination. In 16 patients the primary tumor and in 1 patient a recurrent cancer after primary therapy were examined. All tumors were identified as hypoechoic lesions. Ultrasound examination in the region of the glans was not able to differentiate between invasion of the subepithelial tissue and invasion into the corpus spongiosum, but absence or presence of invasion into the tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum was clearly demonstrated. Accurate measurement by ultrasound of maximum tumor thickness was seen in seven of sixteen examinations. Ultrasound in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis; a useful addition to clinical staging?\n",
